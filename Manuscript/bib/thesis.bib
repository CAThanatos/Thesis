abstract = {The efficiency of social insect colonies critically depends on their ability to efficiently allocate workers to the various tasks which need to be performed. While numerous models have investigated the mechanisms allowing an efficient colony response to external changes in the environment and internal perturbations, little attention has been devoted to the genetic architecture underlying task specialization. We used artificial evolution to compare the performances of three simple genetic architectures underlying within-colony variation in response thresholds of workers to five tasks. In the 'deterministic mapping' system, the thresholds of individuals for each of the five tasks is strictly genetically determined. In the second genetic architecture ('probabilistic mapping'), the genes only influence the probability of engaging in one of the tasks. Finally, in the 'dynamic mapping' system, the propensity of workers to engage in one of the five tasks depends not only on their own genotype, but also on the behavioural phenotypes of other colony members. We found that the deterministic mapping system performed well only when colonies consisted of unrelated individuals and were not subjected to perturbations in task allocation. The probabilistic mapping system performed well for colonies of related and unrelated individuals when there were no perturbations. Finally, the dynamic mapping system performed well under all conditions and was much more efficient than the two other mapping systems when there were perturbations. Overall, our simulations reveal that the type of mapping between genotype and individual behaviour greatly influences the dynamics of task specialization and colony productivity. Our simulations also reveal complex interactions between the mode of mapping, level of within-colony relatedness and risk of colony perturbations.},

abstract = {The simplest diploid form of frequency-dependent selection can generate periodic and chaotic trajectories for the allele frequency. The model is of a randomly mating, infinite diploid population with nonoverlapping generations, segregating for two alleles under frequency-dependent viability selection. The fitness of each genotype is a linear function of the frequencies of the three genotypes. The region in the space of the coefficients that yields cycles and chaos is explored analytically and numerically. The model follows the period-doubling route to chaos, as seen with logistic growth models, but includes additional phenomena such as the simultaneous stability of cycling and chaos. The general condition for cycling or chaos is that the heterozygote deleteriously affect all genotypes. The kinds of ecological interactions that could give rise to the fitness regimes producing cycling and chaos include cannibalism, predator attraction, habitat degradation, and disease transmission.},

@article{Lehman2008,
abstract = {This paper establishes a link between the challenge of solv- ing highly ambitious problems in machine learning and the goal of reproducing the dynamics of open-ended evolution in artificial life. A major problem with the objective function in machine learning is that through deception it may actu- ally prevent the objective from being reached. In a similar way, selection in evolution may sometimes act to discourage increasing complexity. This paper proposes a single idea that both overcomes the obstacle of deception and suggests a sim- ple new approach to open-ended evolution: Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling a domain to cap- ture the open-endedness of natural evolution, the idea is to simply search for novelty. Even in an objective-based prob- lem, such novelty search ignores the objective and searches for behavioral novelty. Yet because many points in the search space collapse to the same point in behavior space, it turns out that the search for novelty is computationally feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behav- iors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. In fact, on the way up the ladder of complexity, the search is likely to encounter at least one solution. In this way, by de- coupling the idea of open-ended search from only artificial life worlds, the raw search for novelty can be applied to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the deceptive maze navigation task in this paper, novelty search significantly out- performs objective-based search, suggesting a surprising new approach to machine learning.},

abstract = {From an evolutionary perspective, social behaviours are those which have fitness consequences for both the individual that performs the behaviour, and another individual. Over the last 43 years, a huge theoretical and empirical literature has developed on this topic. However, progress is often hindered by poor communication between scientists, with different people using the same term to mean different things, or different terms to mean the same thing. This can obscure what is biologically important, and what is not. The potential for such semantic confusion is greatest with interdisciplinary research. Our aim here is to address issues of semantic confusion that have arisen with research on the problem of cooperation. In particular, we: (i) discuss confusion over the terms kin selection, mutualism, mutual benefit, cooperation, altruism, reciprocal altruism, weak altruism, altruistic punishment, strong reciprocity, group selection and direct fitness; (ii) emphasize the need to distinguish between proximate (mechanism) and ultimate (survival value) explanations of behaviours. We draw examples from all areas, but especially recent work on humans and microbes.},

@article{Waibel2011,
abstract = {The evolution of altruism is a fundamental and enduring puzzle in biology. In a seminal paper Hamilton showed that altruism can be selected for when rb - c > 0, where c is the fitness cost to the altruist, b is the fitness benefit to the beneficiary, and r is their genetic relatedness. While many studies have provided qualitative support for Hamilton's rule, quantitative tests have not yet been possible due to the difficulty of quantifying the costs and benefits of helping acts. Here we use a simulated system of foraging robots to experimentally manipulate the costs and benefits of helping and determine the conditions under which altruism evolves. By conducting experimental evolution over hundreds of generations of selection in populations with different c/b ratios, we show that Hamilton's rule always accurately predicts the minimum relatedness necessary for altruism to evolve. This high accuracy is remarkable given the presence of pleiotropic and epistatic effects as well as mutations with strong effects on behavior and fitness (effects not directly taken into account in Hamilton's original 1964 rule). In addition to providing the first quantitative test of Hamilton's rule in a system with a complex mapping between genotype and phenotype, these experiments demonstrate the wide applicability of kin selection theory.},

@article{Floreano2007,
abstract = {Information transfer plays a central role in the biology of most organisms, particularly social species [1, 2]. Although the neurophysiological processes by which signals are produced, conducted, perceived, and interpreted are well understood, the conditions conducive to the evolution of communication and the paths by which reliable systems of communication become established remain largely unknown. This is a particularly challenging problem because efficient communication requires tight coevolution between the signal emitted and the response elicited [3]. We conducted repeated trials of experimental evolution with robots that could produce visual signals to provide information on food location. We found that communication readily evolves when colonies consist of genetically similar individuals and when selection acts at the colony level. We identified several distinct communication systems that differed in their efficiency. Once a given system of communication was well established, it constrained the evolution of more efficient communication systems. Under individual selection, the ability to produce visual signals resulted in the evolution of deceptive communication strategies in colonies of unrelated robots and a concomitant decrease in colony performance. This study generates predictions about the evolutionary conditions conducive to the emergence of communication and provides guidelines for designing artificial evolutionary systems displaying spontaneous communication.},
