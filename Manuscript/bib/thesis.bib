@misc{Aiello1995,
abstract = {Brain tissue is metabolically expensive, but there is no significant correlation between relative basal metabolic rate and relative brain size in humans and other encephalized mammals. The expensive-tissue hypothesis suggests that the metabolic requirements of relatively large brains are offset by a corresponding reduction of the gut. The splanchnic organs (liver and gastrointestinal tract) are as metabolically expensive as brains, and the gut is the only one of the metabolically expensive organs in the human body that is markedly small in relation to body size. Gut size is highly correlated with diet, and relatively small guts are compatible only with high-quality, easy-to-digest food. The often-cited relationship between diet and relative brain size is more properly viewed as a relationship between relative brain size and relative gut size, the latter being determined by dietary quality. No matter what is selecting for relatively large brains in humans and other primates, they cannot be achieved without a shift to a high-quality diet unless there is a rise in the metabolic rate. Therefore the incorporation of increasingly greater amounts of animal products into the diet was essential in the evolution of the large human brain.},

The model is of a randomly mating, infinite diploid population with nonoverlapping generations, segregating for two alleles under frequency-dependent viability selection. The fitness of each genotype is a linear function of the frequencies of the three genotypes. The region in the space of the coefficients that yields cycles and chaos is explored analytically and numerically. The model follows the period-doubling route to chaos, as seen with logistic growth models, but includes additional phenomena such as the simultaneous stability of cycling and chaos. The general condition for cycling or chaos is that the heterozygote deleteriously affect all genotypes. The kinds of ecological interactions that could give rise to the fitness regimes producing cycling and chaos include cannibalism, predator attraction, habitat degradation, and disease transmission.},

abstract = {Social evolution theory faces a puzzle: a gap between theoretical and empirical results on reciprocity. On the one hand, models show that reciprocity should evolve easily in a wide range of circumstances. On the other hand, empirically, few clear instances of reciprocity (even in a broad sense) have been found in nonhuman animals. In this paper, I aim to suggest and evaluate a novel reason concurring to solve this puzzle. I propose that it is difficult for reciprocity to evolve because it raises an evolutionary problem of bootstrapping: it requires that two complementary functions: (i) the ability to cooperate and (ii) the ability to respond conditionally to the cooperation of others, arise together and reach a significant frequency, whereas neither of them can be favoured in the absence of the other. I develop analytical models and simulations showing that, for this reason, the evolutionary emergence of reciprocal cooperation is highly unlikely. I then discuss the consequences of this result for our understanding of cooperation.},

Each element is provided with functions to make decisions with understanding the target of tasks, recognizing surrounding environments, acting, and managing its own conditions, and to communicate with any other components. In order to manage multiple elements to achieve any given task targets, the protocol for communication between elements is discussed for cooperative action between arbitrary elements. This paper deals with the conceptual design of ACTRESS, focusing on the methodology for synthesizing the autonomous and distributed system.

In this paper, we study how a group of physically assembled robots can display coherent behavior on the basis of a simple neural controller that has access only to local sensory information. This controller is synthesized through artificial evolution in a simulated environment in order to let the robots display coordinated-motion behaviors. The evolved controller proves to be robust enough to allow a smooth transfer from simulated to real robots. Additionally, it generalizes to new experimental conditions, such as different sizes/shapes of the group and/or different connection mechanisms. In all these conditions the performance of the neural controller in real robots is comparable to the one obtained in simulation.},

@article{Bergmuller2007a,
abstract = {In cooperative breeding systems, some individuals help to raise offspring that are not their own. While early explanations for such altruistic behaviour were predominantly based on kin selection, recent evidence suggests that direct benefits may be important in the maintenance of cooperation. To date, however, discussions of cooperative breeding have made little reference to more general theories of cooperation between unrelated individuals (while these theories rarely address cooperative breeding). Here, we attempt to integrate the two fields. We identify four key questions that can be used to categorise different mechanisms for the maintenance of cooperative behaviour: (1) whether or not individuals invest in others; (2) whether or not this initial investment elicits a return investment by the beneficiary; (3) whether the interaction is direct, i.e. between two partners, or indirect (involving third parties) and (4) whether only actions that increase the fitness of the partner or also fitness reducing actions (punishment) are involved in the interaction. Asking these questions with regards to concepts in the literature on cooperative breeding, we found that (a) it is often straightforward to relate these concepts to general mechanisms of cooperation, but that (b) a single term (such as 'pay-to-stay', 'group augmentation' or 'prestige') may sometimes subsume two or more distinct mechanisms, and that (c) at least some mechanisms that are thought to be important in cooperative breeding systems have remained largely unexplored in the theoretical literature on the evolution of cooperation. Future theoretical models should incorporate asymmetries in power and pay off structure caused for instance by dominance hierarchies or partner choice, and the use of N-player games. The key challenges for both theoreticians and empiricists will be to integrate the hitherto disparate fields and to disentangle the parallel effects of kin and non-kin based mechanisms of cooperation.},

Individuals co-evolve embedded in their environment. Exploiting the self-assembling capabilities of the (simulated) robots, the genotype of a successful individual can spread in the population.

abstract = {Social insects-ants, bees, termites, and wasps-can be viewed as powerful problem-solving systems with sophisticated collective intelligence. Composed of simple interacting agents, this intelligence lies in the networks of interactions among individuals and between individuals and the environment. A fascinating subject, social insects are also a powerful metaphor for artificial intelligence, and the problems they solve-finding food, dividing labor among nestmates, building nests, responding to external challenges-have important counterparts in engineering and computer science. This book provides a detailed look at models of social insect behavior and how to apply these models in the design of complex systems. The book shows how these models replace an emphasis on control, preprogramming, and centralization with designs featuring autonomy, emergence, and distributed functioning. These designs are proving immensely flexible and robust, able to adapt quickly to changing environments and to continue functioning even when individual elements fail. In particular, these designs are an exciting approach to the tremendous growth of complexity in software and information. Swarm Intelligence draws on up-to-date research from biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, operations research, and computer graphics, and each chapter is organized around a particular biological example, which is then used to develop an algorithm, a multiagent system, or a group of robots. The book will be an invaluable resource for a broad range of disciplines.},

Industrial robots are an example of autonomous yet nonadaptive machines: they execute the same sequence of actions repeatedly. Conversely, unmanned drones are an example of adaptive yet non-autonomous machines: they exhibit the adaptive capabilities of their remote human operators. To date, the only force known to be capable of producing fully autonomous as well as adaptive machines is biological evolution. In the field of evolutionary robotics,9 one class of population-based metaheuristics—evolutionary algorithms—are used to optimize some or all aspects of an autonomous robot.

@article{Bourke2011,
abstract = {Social evolution is a central topic in evolutionary biology, with the evolution of eusociality (societies with altruistic, non-reproductive helpers) representing a long-standing evolutionary conundrum. Recent critiques have questioned the validity of the leading theory for explaining social evolution and eusociality, namely inclusive fitness (kin selection) theory. I review recent and past literature to argue that these critiques do not succeed. Inclusive fitness theory has added fundamental insights to natural selection theory. These are the realization that selection on a gene for social behaviour depends on its effects on co-bearers, the explanation of social behaviours as unalike as altruism and selfishness using the same underlying parameters, and the explanation of within-group conflict in terms of non-coinciding inclusive fitness optima. A proposed alternative theory for eusocial evolution assumes mistakenly that workers' interests are subordinate to the queen's, contains no new elements and fails to make novel predictions. The haplodiploidy hypothesis has yet to be rigorously tested and positive relatedness within diploid eusocial societies supports inclusive fitness theory. The theory has made unique, falsifiable predictions that have been confirmed, and its evidence base is extensive and robust. Hence, inclusive fitness theory deserves to keep its position as the leading theory for social evolution.},

abstract = {Hamilton's rule is a central theorem of inclusive fitness (kin selection) theory and predicts that social behaviour evolves under specific combinations of relatedness, benefit and cost. This review provides evidence for Hamilton's rule by presenting novel syntheses of results from two kinds of study in diverse taxa, including cooperatively breeding birds and mammals and eusocial insects. These are, first, studies that empirically parametrize Hamilton's rule in natural populations and, second, comparative phylogenetic analyses of the genetic, life-history and ecological correlates of sociality. Studies parametrizing Hamilton's rule are not rare and demonstrate quantitatively that (i) altruism (net loss of direct fitness) occurs even when sociality is facultative, (ii) in most cases, altruism is under positive selection via indirect fitness benefits that exceed direct fitness costs and (iii) social behaviour commonly generates indirect benefits by enhancing the productivity or survivorship of kin. Comparative phylogenetic analyses show that cooperative breeding and eusociality are promoted by (i) high relatedness and monogamy and, potentially, by (ii) life-history factors facilitating family structure and high benefits of helping and (iii) ecological factors generating low costs of social behaviour. Overall, the focal studies strongly confirm the predictions of Hamilton's rule regarding conditions for social evolution and their causes.},

@article{Bowers2003,
abstract = {In this paper, we use the theory of adaptive dynamics to highlight the differences in evolutionary behaviour when contrasting formulations of the carrying capacity are used. We use two predator-prey systems, one with a fixed carrying capacity and one in which the carrying capacity is an emergent property compounded of an intrinsic growth rate and a susceptibility to crowding. We consider prey evolution in both systems and link the evolving parameters by a trade-off which requires that prey with higher per capita growth experience a greater risk of predation. We find that the two approaches for representing the carrying capacity can lead to markedly different evolutionary behaviour. In particular, the possibility of exhibiting evolutionary branching requires an emergent carrying capacity. This is significant, since evolutionary branching is regarded as a possible mechanism by which sympatric speciation may occur.},

There has been a great deal of recent research on multiagent reinforcement learning in stochastic games, which is the intuitive extension of MDPs to multiple agents. This recent work, although general, has only been applied to small games with at most hundreds of states. On the other hand robot tasks have continuous, and often complex, state and action spaces. Robot learning tasks demand approximation and generalization techniques, which have only received extensive attention in single-agent learning. In this paper we introduce GraWoLF, a general-purpose, scalable, multiagent learning algorithm. It combines gradient-based policy learning techniques with the WoLF ("Win or Learn Fast") variable learning rate.},

We define an algorithm we call Least-Squares TD (LS TD) for which we prove probability-one convergence when it is used with a function approximator linear in the adjustable parameters. We then define a recursive version of this algorithm, Recursive Least-Squares TD (RLS TD). Although these new TD algorithms require more computation per time-step than do Sutton's TD(A) algorithms, they are more efficient in a statistical sense because they extract more information from training experiences. We describe a simulation experiment showing the substantial improvement in learning rate achieved by RLS TD in an example Markov prediction problem. To quantify this improvement, we introduce the TD error variance of a Markov chain, arc,, and experimentally conclude that the convergence rate of a TD algorithm depends linearly on {\~{}}ro. In addition to converging more rapidly, LS TD and RLS TD do not have control parameters, such as a learning rate parameter, thus eliminating the possibility of achieving poor performance by an unlucky choice of parameters.},

Although bipedal gaits include walking and running, running is generally considered to have played no major role in human evolution because humans, like apes, are poor sprinters compared to most quadrupeds. Here we assess how well humans perform at sustained long-distance running, and review the physiological and anatomical bases of endurance running capabilities in humans and other mammals. Judged by several criteria, humans perform remarkably well at endurance running, thanks to a diverse array of features, many of which leave traces in the skeleton. The fossil evidence of these features suggests that endurance running is a derived capability of the genus Homo, originating about 2 million years ago, and may have been instrumental in the evolution of the human body form.},

The cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus and client reef fish both benefit from an interaction as long as the cleaner eats ectoparasites. However, the cleaner fish prefers some client mucus, which constitutes cheating. Field observations suggested that clients control such cheating by using punishment (chasing the cleaner) or by switching partners (fleeing from the cleaner). Here, we tested experimentally whether such client behaviours result in cooperative cleaner fish. Cleaners were allowed to feed from Plexiglas plates containing prawn items and fish flake items. A lever attached to the plates allowed us to mimic the behaviours of clients. As cleaners showed a strong preference for prawn over flakes, we taught them that eating their preferred food would cause the plate to either chase them or to flee, while feeding on flakes had no negative consequences. We found a significant shift in cleaner fish foraging behaviour towards flake feeding after six learning trials. As punishment and terminating an interaction resulted in the cleaners feeding against their preferences in our experiment, we propose that the same behaviours in clients improve the service quality of cleaners under natural conditions.},

We hypothesize that food-sharing by non-relatives may reduce predation in some communally breeding bird species. If communal fostering reduces the probability that any fledgling's begging attracts a predator, a parent might better share food than restrict care to its own young. To advance our hypothesis we analyse a 2-person game in which foragers exploit a stochastic environment. Food-sharing can be (i) disadvantageous, (ii) the cooperative solution to the game, or (iii) the only stable solution—depending on food density, time constraints, and the degree to which the foragers' offspring are spatially aggregated. We also examine the case where starvation, rather than predation, is the ultimate cost. In this situation food-sharing requires mutual cooperation. Finally, we compare communal and colonial breeding systems with reference to the stability of food-sharing and discuss the model's relevance to the communally breeding Mexican Jay.},

Although the evolution of cooperative breeding has often been attributed primarily to kin selection (whereby individuals gain "indirect" benefits to their fitness by assisting collateral relatives), there is increasing evidence that helpers can be unrelated to the young they are raising. Recent studies also suggest that the indirect benefits of cooperative behavior may often have been overestimated while the direct benefits of helping to the helper's own fitness have probably been underestimated. It now seems likely that the evolutionary mechanisms maintaining cooperative breeding are diverse and that, in some species, the direct benefits of helping may be sufficient to maintain cooperative societies. The benefits of cooperation in vertebrate societies may consequently show parallels with those in human societies, where cooperation between unrelated individuals is frequent and social institutions are often maintained by generalized reciprocity.},

@article{Clutton-Brock2009,
abstract = {Traditional interpretations of the evolution of animal societies have suggested that their structure is a consequence of attempts by individuals to maximize their inclusive fitness within constraints imposed by their social and physical environments. In contrast, some recent re-interpretations have argued that many aspects of social organization should be interpreted as group-level adaptations maintained by selection operating between groups or populations. Here, I review our current understanding of the evolution of mammalian societies, focusing, in particular, on the evolution of reproductive strategies in societies where one dominant female monopolizes reproduction in each group and her offspring are reared by other group members. Recent studies of the life histories of females in these species show that dispersing females often have little chance of establishing new breeding groups and so are likely to maximize their inclusive fitness by helping related dominants to rear their offspring. As in eusocial insects, increasing group size can lead to a progressive divergence in the selection pressures operating on breeders and helpers and to increasing specialization in their behaviour and life histories. As yet, there is little need to invoke group-level adaptations in order to account for the behaviour of individuals or the structure of mammalian groups.},

abstract = {We present a self-organizing model of group formation in three-dimensional space, and use it to investigate the spatial dynamics of animal groups such as fish schools and bird flocks. We reveal the existence of major group-level behavioural transitions related to minor changes in individual-level interactions. Further, we present the first evidence for collective memory in such animal groups (where the previous history of group structure influences the collective behaviour exhibited as individual interactions change) during the transition of a group from one type of collective behaviour to another. The model is then used to show how differences among individuals influence group structure, and how individuals employing simple, local rules of thumb, can accurately change their spatial position within a group (e.g. to move to the centre, the front, or the periphery) in the absence of information on their current position within the group as a whole. These results are considered in the context of the evolution and ecological importance of animal groups.},

@article{Couzin2003,
abstract = {We have looked at different taxonomic groups to reveal where self-organization theory can make an important contribution to explaining collective behavioral patterns. Because this is a newer area of research, and because vertebrate groups may be difficult to study, developing theories of self-organization for these groups (which can then be tested empirically) is particularly challenging. Consequently we focused on how modeling approaches (particularly those that are individual based) have been, and are being, used to help reveal the organizational principles in human crowds (Sections II.B.1 and II.C), ungulate herds (Section II.A), fish schools, bird flocks (Section II.D), and primate groups (Section III.C). The collective behavior of such systems is largely characterized by the interactions among individual components, and thus is well suited to an approach that seeks to elucidate generative behavioral rules. We also discussed the evolution of collective behaviors (Section II.D.3). Here, theory has been important in demonstrating that different collective behaviors can exist for identical individual behaviors, suggesting that the evolution of collective (extended) phenotypes may be more complex than it may, at first, appear. Behavioral differences among individuals within a group may have an important internal structuring influence, and by using simulation models we showed how individuals can modify their positions relative to other group members (e.g., to move relative to the front or center of a group) without necessitating information about their current position within the group (Section III.B). This is important because it is unlikely that individuals within large groups (e.g., pelagic fish schools) can determine their absolute position relative to all other group members; thus we argue that natural selection is likely to act on the kind of local rules we discussed. In Section IV we discussed how local self-organized interactions result in the distribution of animals at a larger spatial and temporal scale, showing how mathematical studies of group size distributions are being used to make testable predictions about how individual behavior translates to that at the level of a population (Sections IV.A and IV.B) and how differences among individuals within a population may lead to phenotypically assorted groups within a population (Section IV.C). We also addressed the "optimal group size" concept (Section IV.D). As an alternative to the view in which individuals explicitly assess the size of groups and then make a decision to leave or join, we showed how local rules of thumb could be used by individuals to modify their probability of being within a group of a given size. We demonstrated that in real organisms (schooling fish) group size distributions (and hence the probability of an individual being within a group of certain size) is context dependent, and that this behavior is entirely consistent with a self-organized mechanism whereby individuals change local interactions as conditions change. In considering self-organization within vertebrate groups it is evident that the organization at one level (e.g., that of the group) relates to that at higher levels (e.g., that of the population). For example, self-sorting processes that lead to internal structuring within groups also result in population-level patterns when such groups fragment (e.g., phenotypic assortment), thus affecting the probability that an individual will be in a group of a given size and composition at any moment in time. These population properties then feed back to the individual interactions by changing the probability of encounters among different members of a population. Thus, to understand collective behaviors fully these properties cannot necessarily be considered in isolation. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

@article{DAmbrosio2008,
abstract = {This paper argues that multiagent learning is a potential killer application for generative and developmental sys- tems (GDS) because key challenges in learning to coordinate a team of agents are naturally addressed through indirect encodings and information reuse. For example, a significant problemformultiagent learning is that policies learned sepa- rately for different agent rolesmay nevertheless need to share a basic skill set, forcing the learning algorithm to reinvent the wheel for each agent. GDS is a good match for this kind of problem because it specializes in ways to encode patterns of related yet varying motifs. In this paper, to establish the promise of this capability, the Hypercube-based NeuroEvo- lution of Augmenting Topologies (HyperNEAT) generative approach to evolving neurocontrollers learns a set of coor- dinated policies encoded by a single genome representing a team of predator agents that work together to capture prey. Experimental results show that it is not only possible, but beneficial to encode a heterogeneous team of agents with an indirect encoding. The main contribution is thus to open up a significant new application domain for GDS},

abstract = {Many important real-world problems, such as patrol or search and rescue, could benefit from the ability to train teams of robots to coordinate. One major challenge to achieving such coordination is de-termining the best way for robots on such teams to communicate with each other. Typical approaches employ hand-designed communication schemes that often require significant effort to engineer. In contrast, this paper presents a new communication scheme called the hive brain, in which the neural network controller of each robot is directly connected to internal nodes of other robots and the weights of these connections are evolved. In this way, the robots can evolve their own internal " language " to speak directly brain-to-brain. This approach is tested in a multirobot patrol synchronization domain where it produces robot controllers that synchronize through communication alone in both simulation and real robots, and that are robust to perturbation and changes in team size.},

abstract = {Individual-based models (IBMs) allow the explicit inclusion of individual variation in greater detail than do classical differential-equation and difference-equation models. Inclusion of such variation is important for continued progress in ecological and evolutionary theory. We provide a conceptual basis for IBMs by describing five major types of individual variation in IBMs: spatial, ontogenetic, phenotypic, cognitive, and genetic. IBMs are now used in almost all subfields of ecology and evolutionary biology. We map those subfields and look more closely at selected key papers on fish recruitment, forest dynamics, sympatric speciation, metapopulation dynamics, maintenance of diversity, and species conservation. Theorists are currently divided on whether IBMs represent only a practical tool for extending classical theory to more complex situations, or whether individual-based theory represents a radically new research program. We feel that the tension between these two poles of thinking can be a source of creativity in ecology and evolutionary theory.},

@article{DeVienne2013,
abstract = {Sex predominates in eukaryotes, despite its short-term disadvantage when compared to asexuality. Myriad models have suggested that short-term advantages of sex may be sufficient to counterbalance its twofold costs. However, despite decades of experimental work seeking such evidence, no evolutionary mechanism has yet achieved broad recognition as explanation for the maintenance of sex. We explore here, through lineage-selection models, the conditions favouring the maintenance of sex. In the first model, we allowed the rate of transition to asexuality to evolve, to determine whether lineage selection favoured species with the strongest constraints preventing the loss of sex. In the second model, we simulated more explicitly the mechanisms underlying the higher extinction rates of asexual lineages than of their sexual counterparts. We linked extinction rates to the ecological and/or genetic features of lineages, thereby providing a formalisation of the only figure included in Darwin's "The origin of species". Our results reinforce the view that the long-term advantages of sex and lineage selection may provide the most satisfactory explanations for the maintenance of sex in eukaryotes, which is still poorly recognized, and provide figures and a simulation website for training and educational purposes. Short-term benefits may play a role, but it is also essential to take into account the selection of lineages for a thorough understanding of the maintenance of sex.},

abstract = {Policy search is a subfield in reinforcement learning which focuses on finding good parameters for a given policy parametrization. It is well suited for robotics as it can cope with high-dimensional state and action spaces, one of the main challenges in robot learning. We review recent successes of both model-free and model-based policy search in robot learning. Model-free policy search is a general approach to learn policies based on sampled trajectories. We classify model-free methods based on their policy evaluation strategy, policy update strategy, and exploration strategy and present a unified view on existing algorithms. Learning a policy is often easier than learning an accurate forward model, and, hence, model-free methods are more frequently used in practice. However, for each sampled trajectory, it is necessary to interact with the robot, which can be time consuming and challenging in practice. Model-based policy search addresses this problem by first learning a simulator of the robot's dynamics from data. Subsequently, the simulator generates trajectories that are used for policy learning. For both model-free and model-based policy search methods, we review their respective properties and their applicability to robotic systems.},

Here I review four pathsthat have been delineated in the study of intra-specific cooperation among animals. These paths - kinship, reciprocity, byproduct mutualism andgroupselection - serve as a starting point for behavioral ecologists interested in studying the initiation and maintenance of cooperation. After reviewing the empirical and theoretical underpinnings of these paths to cooperation, I touch upon some recent work that has attempted to examine (or reexamine) the role of phylogeny, punishment and morality in the light of cooperative behavior.},

abstract = {The evolution of unusually large brains in some groups of animals, notably primates, has long been a puzzle. Although early explanations tended to emphasize the brain's role in sensory or technical competence (foraging skills, innovations, and way-finding), the balance of evidence now clearly favors the suggestion that it was the computational demands of living in large, complex societies that selected for large brains. However, recent analyses suggest that it may have been the particular demands of the more intense forms of pairbonding that was the critical factor that triggered this evolutionary development. This may explain why primate sociality seems to be so different from that found in most other birds and mammals: Primate sociality is based on bonded relationships of a kind that are found only in pairbonds in other taxa.},

These techniques are being increasingly widely applied to a variety of problems, ranging from practical applications in industry and commerce to leading-edge scientific research. This book presents the first complete overview of this exciting field aimed directly at lecturers and graduate and undergraduate students. It is also meant for those who wish to apply evolutionary computing to a particular problem or within a given application area. To this group the book is valuable because it presents EC as something to be used rather than just studied. Last, but not least, this book contains quick-reference information on the current state-of-the-art in a wide range of related topics, so it is of interest not just to evolutionary computing specialists but to researchers working in other fields.},

@article{Elfwing2014a,
abstract = {Polymorphism has fascinated evolutionary biologists since the time of Darwin. Biologists have observed discrete alternative mating strategies in many different species. In this study, we demonstrate that polymorphic mating strategies can emerge in a colony of hermaphrodite robots. We used a survival and reproduction task where the robots maintained their energy levels by capturing energy sources and physically exchanged genotypes for the reproduction of offspring. The reproductive success was dependent on the individuals' energy levels, which created a natural trade-off between the time invested in maintaining a high energy level and the time invested in attracting mating partners. We performed experiments in environments with different density of energy sources and observed a variety in the mating behavior when a robot could see both an energy source and a potential mating partner. The individuals could be classified into two phenotypes: 1) forager, who always chooses to capture energy sources, and 2) tracker, who keeps track of potential mating partners if its energy level is above a threshold. In four out of the seven highest fitness populations in different environments, we found subpopulations with distinct differences in genotype and in behavioral phenotype. We analyzed the fitnesses of the foragers and the trackers by sampling them from each subpopulation and mixing with different ratios in a population. The fitness curves for the two subpopulations crossed at about 25{\%} of foragers in the population, showing the evolutionary stability of the polymorphism. In one of those polymorphic populations, the trackers were further split into two subpopulations: (strong trackers) and (weak trackers). Our analyses show that the population consisting of three phenotypes also constituted several stable polymorphic evolutionarily stable states. To our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate the emergence of polymorphic evolutionarily stable strategies within a robot evolution framework.},

abstract = {Human cooperation is an evolutionary puzzle. Unlike other creatures, people frequently cooperate with genetically unrelated strangers, often in large groups, with people they will never meet again, and when reputation gains are small or absent. These patterns of cooperation cannot be explained by the nepotistic motives associated with the evolutionary theory of kin selection and the selfish motives associated with signalling theory or the theory of reciprocal altruism. Here we show experimentally that the altruistic punishment of defectors is a key motive for the explanation of cooperation. Altruistic punishment means that individuals punish, although the punishment is costly for them and yields no material gain. We show that cooperation flourishes if altruistic punishment is possible, and breaks down if it is ruled out. The evidence indicates that negative emotions towards defectors are the proximate mechanism behind altruistic punishment. These results suggest that future study of the evolution of human cooperation should include a strong focus on explaining altruistic punishment.},

In some of them, results have been very successful, but some tasks present several characteristics that make the application of reinforcement learning harder to define. One of these areas is multi-robot learning, which has two important problems. The first is credit assignment, or how to define the reinforcement signal to each robot belonging to a cooperative team depending on the results achieved by the whole team. The second one is working with large domains, where the amount of data can be large and different in each moment of a learning step. This paper studies both issues in a multi-robot environment, showing that introducing domain knowledge and machine learning algorithms can be combined to achieve successful cooperative behaviours.},

@article{Ferrante2015,
abstract = {Division of labor is ubiquitous in biological systems, as evidenced by various forms of complex task specialization observed in both animal societies and multicellular organisms. Although clearly adaptive, the way in which division of labor first evolved remains enigmatic, as it requires the simultaneous co-occurrence of several complex traits to achieve the required degree of coordination. Recently, evolutionary swarm robotics has emerged as an excellent test bed to study the evolution of coordinated group-level behavior. Here we use this framework for the first time to study the evolutionary origin of behavioral task specialization among groups of identical robots. The scenario we study involves an advanced form of division of labor, common in insect societies and known as "task partitioning", whereby two sets of tasks have to be carried out in sequence by different individuals. Our results show that task partitioning is favored whenever the environment has features that, when exploited, reduce switching costs and increase the net efficiency of the group, and that an optimal mix of task specialists is achieved most readily when the behavioral repertoires aimed at carrying out the different subtasks are available as pre-adapted building blocks. Nevertheless, we also show for the first time that self-organized task specialization could be evolved entirely from scratch, starting only from basic, low-level behavioral primitives, using a nature-inspired evolutionary method known as Grammatical Evolution. Remarkably, division of labor was achieved merely by selecting on overall group performance, and without providing any prior information on how the global object retrieval task was best divided into smaller subtasks. We discuss the potential of our method for engineering adaptively behaving robot swarms and interpret our results in relation to the likely path that nature took to evolve complex sociality and task specialization.},

@article{Ferriere2002,
abstract = {Interspecific mutualisms have been playing a central role in the functioning of all ecosystems since the early history of life. Yet the theory of coevolution of mutualists is virtually nonexistent, by contrast with well-developed coevolutionary theories of competition, predator-prey and host-parasite interactions. This has prevented resolution of a basic puzzle posed by mutualisms: their persistence in spite of apparent evolutionary instability. The selective advantage of 'cheating', that is, reaping mutualistic benefits while providing fewer commodities to the partner species, is commonly believed to erode a mutualistic interaction, leading to its dissolution or reciprocal extinction. However, recent empirical findings indicate that stable associations of mutualists and cheaters have existed over long evolutionary periods. Here, we show that asymmetrical competition within species for the commodities offered by mutualistic partners provides a simple and testable ecological mechanism that can account for the long-term persistence of mutualisms. Cheating, in effect, establishes a background against which better mutualists can display any competitive superiority. This can lead to the coexistence and divergence of mutualist and cheater phenotypes, as well as to the coexistence of ecologically similar, but unrelated mutualists and cheaters.},

abstract = {Increased encephalization, or larger brain volume relative to body mass, is a repeated theme in vertebrate evolution. Here we present an extensive sampling of relative brain sizes in fossil and extant taxa in the mammalian order Carnivora (cats, dogs, bears, weasels, and their relatives). By using Akaike Information Criterion model selection and endocranial volume and body mass data for 289 species (including 125 fossil taxa), we document clade-specific evolutionary transformations in encephalization allometries. These evolutionary transformations include multiple independent encephalization increases and decreases in addition to a remarkably static basal Carnivora allometry that characterizes much of the suborder Feliformia and some taxa in the suborder Caniformia across much of their evolutionary history, emphasizing that complex processes shaped the modern distribution of encephalization across Carnivora. This analysis also permits critical evaluation of the social brain hypothesis (SBH), which predicts a close association between sociality and increased encephalization. Previous analyses based on living species alone appeared to support the SBH with respect to Carnivora, but those results are entirely dependent on data from modern Canidae (dogs). Incorporation of fossil data further reveals that no association exists between sociality and encephalization across Carnivora and that support for sociality as a causal agent of encephalization increase disappears for this clade.},

abstract = {Information transfer plays a central role in the biology of most organisms, particularly social species [1, 2]. Although the neurophysiological processes by which signals are produced, conducted, perceived, and interpreted are well understood, the conditions conducive to the evolution of communication and the paths by which reliable systems of communication become established remain largely unknown. This is a particularly challenging problem because efficient communication requires tight coevolution between the signal emitted and the response elicited [3]. We conducted repeated trials of experimental evolution with robots that could produce visual signals to provide information on food location. We found that communication readily evolves when colonies consist of genetically similar individuals and when selection acts at the colony level. We identified several distinct communication systems that differed in their efficiency. Once a given system of communication was well established, it constrained the evolution of more efficient communication systems. Under individual selection, the ability to produce visual signals resulted in the evolution of deceptive communication strategies in colonies of unrelated robots and a concomitant decrease in colony performance. This study generates predictions about the evolutionary conditions conducive to the emergence of communication and provides guidelines for designing artificial evolutionary systems displaying spontaneous communication.},

But they are not obviously truethere are counterexamples in theory to both of themand my main purposes in this chapter are to trace the logic underlying them, to identify the justification that has been found for them, and to display the connections between these usable principals of behavioural ecology and the more fundamental principal of natural selection. This chapter will mainly justify what many people already believe, but this is an important exercise. The central concept of inclusive fitness is routinely misdefinied and occasionally misused. Some confusiton still surrounds the problem of group selection. Only by concentrating on the logical grounds of our orthodoxy can we clarify and defend it. The rest of this chapter is divided into three parts. The first describes how population genetics is fundamental to behavioural ecology, but also how we may be able to avoid dealing with its complications in everyday practice. The second traces the logic underlying inclusive fitness. The last discusses what natural selection tells us about the evolution of animals in groups.},

abstract = {Species recognition and group member recognition systems produce an ability to discriminate conspecifics by genetic similarity on first encounter when kin recognition is absent. Experimental evidence of such discrimination is therefore insufficient evidence for kin recognition. The evolution of a true kin recognition system depends on three kinds of loci: matching, detection and using. Matching loci, which affect the traits used to detect kin, will have a higher genetic similarity between interactants than their common ancestry alone suggests. Selection has been erroneously thought to cause individuals to behave according to the higher relatedness implied by this extra similarity. The detection loci and using loci are not expected to be closely linked to the matching loci, implying that individuals will behave according to the relatedness based on their common ancestry. Polymorphism at the matching loci is essential for effective discrimination of kin, and is sustained by the evolution of the kin recognition system in those cases where it is advantageous to interact with kin. ?? 1990 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {In many cooperatively breeding vertebrates, a dominant breeding pair is assisted in offspring care by nonbreeding helpers. A leading explanation for this altruistic behavior is Hamilton's idea that helpers gain indirect fitness benefits by rearing relatives (kin selection). Many studies have shown that helpers typically provide care for relatives, but relatively few have shown that helpers provide closer kin with preferential care (kin discrimination), fueling the suggestion that kin selection only poorly accounts for the evolution of cooperative breeding in vertebrates. We used meta-analysis to show that (i) individuals consistently discriminate between kin, and (ii) stronger discrimination occurs in species where the benefits of helping are greater. These results suggest a general role for kin selection and that the relative importance of kin selection varies across species, as predicted by Hamilton's rule.},

What conceptual framework do we use when the classical differential equation framework no longer applies?

@article{Gueron1996,
abstract = {The dynamic behavior of small herds is investigated by means of simulations of two-dimensional discrete stochastic models. An individual-based approach is used to relate collective behavior to individual decisions. In our model, the motion of an individual in a herd is assumed to be the combined result of both density-independent and density-dependent decisions, in the latter case based on the influence of surrounding neighbors; assumed decision rules are hierarchical, balancing short-range repulsion against long-range attraction. The probability of fragmentation of the model herd depends on parameter values. We explore the variety and characteristics of spatial patterns that develop during migration, for herds that are homogeneous or heterogeneous regarding intrinsic walking speeds. Group integrity can be maintained even in mixed populations, but fragmentation results for these more easily than for a homogeneous herd. Observations of natural populations suggest that animals move away from individuals that intrude too closely into their environment, but are attracted to individuals at a distance. Between these extremes, there appears to be a neutral zone, within which other individuals engender no response. We explore the importance of this neutral zone, and offer evolutionary interpretations. In particular, the neutral zone, if not too large, permits the individual to remain in contact with the herd, while reducing the frequency with which acceleration or deceleration must be undertaken. This offers obvious energetic benefits. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited},

abstract = {The application of reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems has attracted recent attention. In multi-agent systems, the state space to be handled constitutes a major problem efficiently in learning of agents. In order to cooperate agents in the same environment, it is needed to observe and evaluate the action of other agents in the multi-agent system. This case increases the dimension of state space proportional to the number of agents, exponentially. This paper presents a novel approach to overcome this problem. The approach uses together the advantages of the modular architecture, internal model and fuzzy logic in multi-agent systems. In our cooperation method, one agent estimates its action according to the internal model of the other agent. The internal model is acquired by the observation and evaluation of the other agent's actions. Fuzzy logic maps from input fuzzy sets, representing state space of each learning module to the output fuzzy sets representing the action space. The fuzzy rule base of each learning module is built through the Qlearning. Experimental results handled on pursuit domain show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.},

@article{Hamilton1971,
abstract = {This paper presents an antithesis to the view that gregarious behaviour is evolved through benefits to the population or species. Following Galton (1871) and Williams (1964) gregarious behaviour is considered as a form of cover-seeking in which each animal tries to reduce its chance of being caught by a predator. It is easy to see how pruning of marginal individuals can maintain centripetal instincts in already gregarious species; some evidence that marginal pruning actually occurs is summarized. Besides this, simply defined models are used to show that even in non-gregarious species selection is likely to favour individuals who stay close to others. Although not universal or unipotent, cover-seeking is a widespread and important element in animal aggregation, as the literature shows. Neglect of the idea has probably followed from a general disbelief that evolution can be dysgenic for a species. Nevertheless, selection theory provides no support for such disbelief in the case of species with outbreeding or unsubdivided populations. The model for two dimensions involves a complex problem in geometrical probability which has relevance also in metallurgy and communication science. Some empirical data on this, gathered from random number plots, is presented as of possible heuristic value. ?? 1971.},

abstract = {The subject matter of evolutionary game theory is the analysis of conflict and cooperation in animals and plants. Originally, game theory was developed as a theory of human strategic behavior based on an idealized picture of rational decision making. Evolutionary game theory does not rely on rationality assumptions but on the idea that the Darwinian process of natural selection drives organisms toward the optimization of reproductive success. Most of evolutionary game theory focuses on those cases where stable equilibrium is reached. However, the dynamics of evolutionary processes in disequilibrium is also an active area of research. In principle, evolutionary game theory deals only with fully symmetric games. Asymmetric conflicts are embedded in symmetric games where each player has the same chance to be on each side of the conflict. The mathematical definition of evolutionary stability refers to symmetric games only. Because asymmetric conflicts can be embedded in symmetric games, this is no obstacle for the treatment of asymmetric conflicts.},

@article{Hammerstein2003,
abstract = {(from the chapter) After three decades of worldwide research on reciprocal altruism and related phenomena, no more than a modest number of animal examples have been identified. Even in primates, evidence for reciprocity is surprisingly scarce. In contrast to the shortage of support, reciprocal altruism and Tit-for-Tat-like behavior have been used as the prime explanation for cooperation among nonkin. From models based on this line of reasoning, one easily gets the impression that reciprocity should be widespread among social animals. Why is there such a discrepancy between theory and facts? A look at the best known examples of reciprocity shows that simple models of repeated games do not properly reflect the natural circumstances under which evolution takes place. Most repeated animal interactions do not even correspond to repeated games. Partner switching and mobility often counteract the evolutionary stability of reciprocal altruism. Moreover, if learning is involved in mental implementation, then the timescale in which reciprocity can occur is often dramatically shortened. In the few known examples, quick reciprocation seems to be the rule, yet standard game theory fails to account for this empirical finding. More generally, it must be emphasized that mental mechanisms shape the evolution of reciprocity. An impressive mental machinery is required for nontrivial examples of reciprocity, as illustrated by the attribution problem (i.e., the problem of classifying other individuals' actions as cooperative, intentionally uncooperative, or unintentionally uncooperative). Emotions may play a role in the machinery underlying cooperation, but current game theory is conceptually not designed to account for the role emotions play. Collectively, this shows that many obstacles can impede the evolution of reciprocity and that evolutionary game theory needs new conceptual tools to understand these obstacles adequately.

abstract = {Individual bacterial cells can communicate via quorum sensing, cooperate to harvest nutrients from their environment, form multicellular biofilms, compete over resources and even kill one another. When the environment that bacteria inhabit is an animal host, these social behaviours mediate virulence. Over the last decade, much attention has focussed on the ecology, evolution and pathology of bacterial cooperation, and the possibility that it could be exploited or destabilised to treat infections. But how far can we really extrapolate from theoretical predictions and laboratory experiments to make inferences about 'cooperative' behaviours in hosts and reservoirs? To determine the likely importance and evolution of cooperation 'in the wild', several questions must be addressed. A recent paper that reports the dynamics of bacterial cooperation and virulence in a field experiment provides an excellent nucleus for bringing together key empirical and theoretical results which help us to frame - if not completely to answer - these questions.},

abstract = {Adult female and male impala engage in a type of allogrooming in which partners alternately deliver bouts of oral grooming to the head and neck. These grooming encounters comprise typically six to 12 tit-for-tat-like exchanges of bouts and are highly reciprocal among adult females, adult bachelor males and subadult males. Although allogrooming among females could be between related individuals, that occurring among adult males would appear to be between unrelated individuals. Unlike allogrooming reported for some primate species and other ungulates, the dominant impala received no more grooming than the subordinate. It is proposed that one function of impala allogrooming is to reduce the ectoparasite load on body areas an animal cannot reach with its own mouth. The impala reciprocal allogrooming system is unique among free-ranging antelope and other ungulates and may be a candidate for the tit-fortat strategy of evolved cooperation. ?? 1992 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

@article{Hauert2004,
abstract = {Understanding the emergence of cooperation is a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology1. Evolutionary game theory2, 3 has become a powerful framework with which to investigate this problem. Two simple games have attracted most attention in theoretical and experimental studies: the Prisoner's Dilemma4 and the snowdrift game (also known as the hawk–dove or chicken game)5. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the non-cooperative state is evolutionarily stable, which has inspired numerous investigations of suitable extensions that enable cooperative behaviour to persist. In particular, on the basis of spatial extensions of the Prisoner's Dilemma, it is widely accepted that spatial structure promotes the evolution of cooperation6, 7, 8. Here we show that no such general predictions can be made for the effects of spatial structure in the snowdrift game. In unstructured snowdrift games, intermediate levels of cooperation persist. Unexpectedly, spatial structure reduces the proportion of cooperators for a wide range of parameters. In particular, spatial structure eliminates cooperation if the cost-to-benefit ratio of cooperation is high. Our results caution against the common belief that spatial structure is necessarily beneficial for cooperative behaviour.},

@article{Hauert2009,
abstract = {In most swarm systems, agents are either aware of the position of their direct neighbors or they possess a sub- strate on which they can deposit information (stigmergy). However, such resources are not always obtainable in real- world applications because of hardware and environmental constraints. In this paper we study in 2D simulation the de- sign of a swarm system which does not make use of posi- tioning information or stigmergy. This endeavor is motivated by an application whereby a large number of Swarming Micro Air Vehicles (SMAVs), of fixed-wing configuration, must organize autonomously to establish a wireless communication network (SMAVNET) between users located on ground. Rather than relative or ab- solute positioning, agents must rely only on their own head- ing measurements and local communication with neighbors. Designing local interactions responsible for the emer- gence of the SMAVNET deployment and maintenance is a challenging task. For this reason, artificial evolution is used to automatically develop neuronal controllers for the swarm of homogenous agents. This approach has the advantage of yielding original and efficient swarming strategies. A de- tailed behavioral analysis is then performed on the fittest swarm to gain insight as to the behavior of the individual agents},

@article{Hauert2011,
abstract = {The success of swarm behaviors often depends on the range at which robots can communicate and the speed at which they change their behavior. Challenges arise when the communication range is too small with respect to the dynamics of the robot, preventing interactions from lasting long enough to achieve coherent swarming. To alleviate this dependency, most swarm experiments done in laboratory environments rely on communication hardware that is relatively long range and wheeled robotic platforms that have omnidirectional motion. Instead, we focus on deploying a swarm of small fixed-wing flying robots. Such platforms have limited payload, resulting in the use of short-range communication hardware. Furthermore, they are required to maintain forward motion to avoid stalling and typically adopt low turn rates because of physical or energy constraints. The tradeoff between communication range and flight dynamics is exhaustively studied in simulation in the scope of Reynolds flocking and demonstrated with up to 10 robots in outdoor experiments.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) reasoning technology involving, e.g., inference, planning, and learning, has a track record with a healthy number of successful applications. So, can it be used as a toolbox of methods for autonomous mobile robots? Not necessarily, as reasoning on a mobile robot about its dynamic, partially known environment may differ substantially from that in knowledge-based pure software systems, where most of the named successes have been registered. This Chapter sketches the main robotics-relevant topics of symbol-based AI reasoning. Basic methods of knowledge representation and inference are described in general, covering both logic- and probability-based approaches. Then, some robotics-related particularities are addressed specially: issues in logic-based high-level robot control, fuzzy logics, and reasoning under time constraints. Two generic applications of reasoning are then described in some detail: action planning and learning. General reasoning is currently not a standard feature onboard autonomous mobile robots. Beyond sketching the state of the art in robotics-related AI reasoning, this Chapter points to the involved research problems that remain to be solved towards that end. The Chapter first reviews knowledge representation and deduction in general (Sect. 9.1), and then goes into some detail regarding reasoning issues that are considered particularly relevant for applications in robots (Sect. 9.2). Having presented reasoning methods, we then enter the field of generic reasoning applications, namely, action planning (Sect. 9.3) and machine learning (Sect. 9.4). Section 9.5 concludes.},

abstract = {Genetic algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in studies of complex adaptive systems, ranging from adaptive agents in economic theory to the use of machine learning techniques in the design of complex devices such as aircraft turbines and integrated circuits. Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications. In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements.},

@article{Kapetanakis2005,
abstract = {Most approaches to the learning of coordination in multi-agent systems (MAS) to date require all agents to use the same learning algorithm with similar (or even the same) parameter settings. In today's open networks and high inter-connectivity such an assumption becomes increasingly unrealistic. Developers are starting to have less control over the agents that join the system and the learning algorithms they employ. This makes effective coordination and good learning performance extremely difficult to achieve, especially in the absence of learning agent standards. In this paper we investigate the problem of learning to coordinate with heterogeneous agents. We show that an agent employing the FMQ algorithm, a recently developed multi-agent learning method, has the ability to converge towards the optimal joint action when teamed-up with one or more simple Q-learners. Specifically, we show such convergence in scenarios where simple Q-learners alone are unable to converge towards an optimum. Our results show that system designers may improve learning and coordination performance by adding a "smart" agent to the MAS.},

Why do symbionts provide costly services to a host, indirectly benefiting competitors sharing the same individual host? Host monitoring of symbiont performance and the imposition of sanctions on 'cheats' could stabilize mutualism. Here we show that soybeans penalize rhizobia that fail to fix N(2) inside their root nodules. We prevented a normally mutualistic rhizobium strain from cooperating (fixing N(2)) by replacing air with an N(2)-free atmosphere (Ar:O(2)). A series of experiments at three spatial scales (whole plants, half root systems and individual nodules) demonstrated that forcing non-cooperation (analogous to cheating) decreased the reproductive success of rhizobia by about 50{\%}. Non-invasive monitoring implicated decreased O(2) supply as a possible mechanism for sanctions against cheating rhizobia. More generally, such sanctions by one or both partners may be important in stabilizing a wide range of mutualistic symbioses.},

abstract = {Achieving tasks with multiple robots will require a control system that is both simple and scalable as the number of robots increases. Collective behavior as demonstrated by social insects is a form of decentralized control that may prove useful in controlling multiple robots. Nature's several examples of collective behavior have motivated our approach to controlling a multiple robot system using a group behavior. Our mechanisms, used to invoke the group behavior, allow the system of robots to perform tasks without centralized control or explicit communication. We have constructed a system of five mobile robots capable of achieving simple collective tasks to verify the results obtained in simulation. The results suggest that decentralized control without explicit communication can be used to perform cooperative tasks requiring a collective behavior.},

@article{LeGalliard2005,
abstract = {Social behavior involves "staying and helping," two individual attributes that vary considerably among organisms. Investigating the ultimate causes of such variation, this study integrates previously separate lines of research by analyzing the joint evolution of altruism and mobility. We unfold the network of selective pressures and derive how these depend on physiological costs, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, and a complex interaction between the evolving traits. Our analysis highlights habitat saturation, both around individuals (local aggregation) and around unoccupied space (local contention), as the key mediator of altruism and mobility evolution. Once altruism and mobility are allowed to evolve jointly, three general insights emerge. First, the cost of mobility affects the origin of altruism, determining whether and how quickly selfishness is overcome. Second, the cost of altruism determines which of two qualitatively different routes to sociality are taken: an evolutionary reduction of mobility, resulting in higher habitat saturation, is either preceded or followed by the adaptive rise of altruism. Third, contrary to conventional expectations, a positive correlation between evolutionarily stable levels of altruism and mobility can arise; this is expected when comparing populations that evolved under different constraints on mobility or that differ in other life-history traits.},

abstract = {This paper establishes a link between the challenge of solv- ing highly ambitious problems in machine learning and the goal of reproducing the dynamics of open-ended evolution in artificial life. A major problem with the objective function in machine learning is that through deception it may actu- ally prevent the objective from being reached. In a similar way, selection in evolution may sometimes act to discourage increasing complexity. This paper proposes a single idea that both overcomes the obstacle of deception and suggests a sim- ple new approach to open-ended evolution: Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling a domain to cap- ture the open-endedness of natural evolution, the idea is to simply search for novelty. Even in an objective-based prob- lem, such novelty search ignores the objective and searches for behavioral novelty. Yet because many points in the search space collapse to the same point in behavior space, it turns out that the search for novelty is computationally feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behav- iors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. In fact, on the way up the ladder of complexity, the search is likely to encounter at least one solution. In this way, by de- coupling the idea of open-ended search from only artificial life worlds, the raw search for novelty can be applied to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the deceptive maze navigation task in this paper, novelty search significantly out- performs objective-based search, suggesting a surprising new approach to machine learning.},

abstract = {In evolutionary computation, the fitness function normally measures progress toward an objective in the search space, effectively acting as an objective function. Through deception, such objective functions may actually prevent the objective from being reached. While methods exist to mitigate deception, they leave the underlying pathology untreated: Objective functions themselves may actively misdirect search toward dead ends. This paper proposes an approach to circumventing deception that also yields a new perspective on open-ended evolution. Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling natural evolution to capture open-endedness, the idea is to simply search for behavioral novelty. Even in an objective-based problem, such novelty search ignores the objective. Because many points in the search space collapse to a single behavior, the search for novelty is often feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behaviors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. By decoupling open-ended search from artificial life worlds, the search for novelty is applicable to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the maze navigation and biped walking tasks in this paper, novelty search significantly outperforms objective-based search, suggesting the strange conclusion that some problems are best solved by methods that ignore the objective. The main lesson is the inherent limitation of the objective-based paradigm and the unexploited opportunity to guide search through other means.},

abstract = {Why evolvability appears to have increased over evolutionary time is an important unresolved biological question. Unlike most candidate explanations, this paper proposes that increasing evolvability can result without any pressure to adapt. The insight is that if evolvability is heritable, then an unbiased drifting process across genotypes can still create a distribution of phenotypes biased towards evolvability, because evolvable organisms diffuse more quickly through the space of possible phenotypes. Furthermore, because phenotypic divergence often correlates with founding niches, niche founders may on average be more evolvable, which through population growth provides a genotypic bias towards evolvability. Interestingly, the combination of these two mechanisms can lead to increasing evolvability without any pressure to out-compete other organisms, as demonstrated through experiments with a series of simulated models. Thus rather than from pressure to adapt, evolvability may inevitably result from any drift through genotypic space combined with evolution's passive tendency to accumulate niches.},

abstract = {One of the enduring puzzles in biology and the social sciences is the origin and persistence of intraspecific cooperation and altruism in humans and other species. Hundreds of theoretical models have been proposed and there is much confusion about the relationship between these models. To clarify the situation, we developed a synthetic conceptual framework that delineates the conditions necessary for the evolution of altruism and cooperation. We show that at least one of the four following conditions needs to be fulfilled: direct benefits to the focal individual performing a cooperative act; direct or indirect information allowing a better than random guess about whether a given individual will behave cooperatively in repeated reciprocal interactions; preferential interactions between related individuals; and genetic correlation between genes coding for altruism and phenotypic traits that can be identified. When one or more of these conditions are met, altruism or cooperation can evolve if the cost-to-benefit ratio of altruistic and cooperative acts is greater than a threshold value. The cost-to-benefit ratio can be altered by coercion, punishment and policing which therefore act as mechanisms facilitating the evolution of altruism and cooperation. All the models proposed so far are explicitly or implicitly built on these general principles, allowing us to classify them into four general categories.},

We review the success or otherwise of work investigating alternative processes and mechanisms, most of which fall under the heading of cooperation for direct benefits. We evaluate to what extent concepts such as by-product benefits, pseudo-reciprocity, sanctions and partner choice, markets and the build-up of cross-species spatial trait correlations have contributed to the study of the evolution of cooperation. We conclude that these alternative ideas are successful and show potential to further increase our understanding of cooperation. We also bring up the origin and role of common interest in the evolution of cooperation, including the appearance of organisms. We note that there are still unresolved questions about the main processes contributing to the evolution of common interest. Commenting on the broader significance of the recent developments, we argue that they represent a justified balancing of the importance given to different major hypotheses for the evolution of cooperation. This balancing is beneficial because it widens considerably the range of phenomena addressed and, crucially, encourages empirical testing of important theoretical alternatives.},

abstract = {Optimizing collective behavior in multiagent systems requires algorithms to find not only appropriate individual behaviors but also a suitable composition of agents within a team. Over the last two decades, evolutionary methods have emerged as a promising approach for the design of agents and their compositions into teams. The choice of a crossover operator that facilitates the evolution of optimal team composition is recognized to be crucial, but so far, it has never been thoroughly quantified. Here, we highlight the limitations of two different crossover operators that exchange entire agents between teams: restricted agent swapping (RAS) that exchanges only corresponding agents between teams and free agent swapping (FAS) that allows an arbitrary exchange of agents. Our results show that RAS suffers from premature convergence, whereas FAS entails insufficient convergence. Consequently, in both cases, the exploration and exploitation aspects of the evolutionary algorithm are not well balanced resulting in the evolution of suboptimal team compositions. To overcome this problem, we propose combining the two methods. Our approach first applies FAS to explore the search space and then RAS to exploit it. This mixed approach is a much more efficient strategy for the evolution of team compositions compared to either strategy on its own. Our results suggest that such a mixed agent-swapping algorithm should always be preferred whenever the optimal composition of individuals in a multiagent system is unknown.},

Game theory provides a mathematical language for understanding evolution by natural selection. Continuous-trait game theory starts with the notion of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) and adds the concept of convergence stability (that the ESS is an evolutionary attractor). With these basic tools in hand, continuous-trait game theory can be easily extended to model evolution under conditions of disruptive selection and speciation, nonequilibrium population dynamics, stochastic environments, coevolution, and more. Many models applying these tools to evolutionary ecology and coevolution have been developed in the past two decades.

@article{Mitri2013,
abstract = {A major challenge in studying social behaviour stems from the need to disentangle the behaviour of each individual from the resulting collective. One way to overcome this problem is to construct a model of the behaviour of an individual, and observe whether combining many such individuals leads to the predicted outcome. This can be achieved by using robots. In this review we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of such an approach for studies of social behaviour. We find that robots-whether studied in groups of simulated or physical robots, or used to infiltrate and manipulate groups of living organisms-have important advantages over conventional individual-based models and have contributed greatly to the study of social behaviour. In particular, robots have increased our understanding of self-organization and the evolution of cooperative behaviour and communication. However, the resulting findings have not had the desired impact on the biological community. We suggest reasons for why this may be the case, and how the benefits of using robots can be maximized in future research on social behaviour.},

abstract = {The swarm intelligence paradigm has proven to have very interesting properties such as robustness, flexibility and ability to solve complex problems exploiting parallelism and self-organization. Several robotics implementations of this paradigm confirm that these properties can be exploited for the control of a population of physically independent mobile robots. The work presented here introduces a new robotic concept called swarm-bot in which the collective interaction exploited by the swarm intelligence mechanism goes beyond the control layer and is extended to the physical level. This implies the addition of new mechanical functionalities on the single robot, together with new electronics and software to manage it. These new functionalities, even if not directly related to mobility and navigation, allow to address complex mobile robotics problems, such as extreme all-terrain exploration. The work shows also how this new concept is investigated using a simulation tool (swarmbot3d) specifically developed for quickly designing and evaluating new control algorithms. Experimental work shows how the simulated detailed representation of one s-bot has been calibrated to match the behaviour of the real robot.},

In particular, we show how activity in the cerebral cortex can make predictions about future receipt of reward and how fluctuations in the activity levels of neurons in diffuse dopamine systems above and below baseline levels would represent errors in these predictions that are delivered to cortical and subcortical targets. We present a model for how such errors could be constructed in a real brain that is consistent with physiological results for a subset of dopaminergic neurons located in the ventral tegmental area and surrounding dopaminergic neurons. The theory also makes testable predictions about human choice behavior on a simple decision-making task. Furthermore, we show that, through a simple influence on synaptic plasticity, fluctuations in dopamine release can act to change the predictions in an appropriate manner.},

@article{Mouret2012a,
abstract = {Evolutionary robotics (ER) aims at automatically designing robots or controllers of robots without having to describe their inner workings. To reach this goal, ER researchers primarily employ phenotypes that can lead to an infinite number of robot behaviors and fitness functions that only reward the achievement of the task-and not how to achieve it. These choices make ER particularly prone to premature convergence. To tackle this problem, several papers recently proposed to explicitly encourage the diversity of the robot behaviors, rather than the diversity of the genotypes as in classic evolutionary optimization. Such an approach avoids the need to compute distances between structures and the pitfalls of the noninjectivity of the phenotype/behavior relation; however, it also introduces new questions: how to compare behavior? should this comparison be task specific? and what is the best way to encourage diversity in this context? In this paper, we review the main published approaches to behavioral diversity and benchmark them in a common framework. We compare each approach on three different tasks and two different genotypes. The results show that fostering behavioral diversity substantially improves the evolutionary process in the investigated experiments, regardless of genotype or task. Among the benchmarked approaches, multi-objective methods were the most efficient and the generic, Hamming-based, behavioral distance was at least as efficient as task specific behavioral metrics.},

abstract = {In robotics, gradient-free optimization algorithms (e.g. evolutionary algorithms) are often used only in simulation because they require the evaluation of many candidate solutions. Nevertheless, solutions obtained in simulation often do not work well on the real device. The transferability approach aims at crossing this gap between simulation and reality by $\backslash$emph{\{}making the optimization algorithm aware of the limits of the simulation{\}}. In the present paper, we first describe the transferability function, that maps solution descriptors to a score representing how well a simulator matches the reality. We then show that this function can be learned using a regression algorithm and a few experiments with the real devices. Our results are supported by an extensive study of the reality gap for a simple quadruped robot whose control parameters are optimized. In particular, we mapped the whole search space in reality and in simulation to understand the differences between the fitness landscapes.},

The task requires robots to gather building blocks and assemble the blocks in specific sequences in order to build structures.

@article{Nunney1989,
abstract = {The traditional group-selection model for the maintenance of sex is based upon the assumption that the long-term evolutionary benefits of sexual reproduction result in asexual lineages having a higher extinction rate than sexual species. This model is reexamined, as is a related model that incorporates the possibility that sexual and asexual lines differ in their speciation rates. In these models, the long-term advantage of sex is opposed by a strong short-term disadvantage arising from the twofold reproductive cost of producing males. It is shown that once some sexual lines become established, then group selection can act to maintain sex despite its short-term disadvantage. The short-term disadvantage is included in the model by assuming that, if asexual individuals arise by mutation within a previously completely sexual species, then the asexuals quickly displace their sexual conspecifics and the species is transformed to asexuality. The probability of this event is given by the transition rate, us. If the value of us varies between lineages, then one of the effects of group selection is to favor groups (i.e., species) with the lowest values of us. This occurs because lines that do convert to asexuality (because of a high us) are doomed to a high rate of extinction, and in the long term only those that do not convert to asexuality (because of a low us) survive. The net result of group selection is that sex is maintained because of its lower extinction rate (or higher speciation rate) and because asexual mutants only rarely arise.

@article{OConnell2002,
abstract = {Archaeological data are frequently cited in support of the idea that big game hunting drove the evolution of early Homo, mainly through its role in offspring provisioning. This argument has been disputed on two grounds: (1) ethnographic observations on modern foragers show that although hunting may contribute a large fraction of the overall diet, it is an unreliable day-to-day food source, pursued more for status than subsistence; (2) archaeological evidence from the Plio-Pleistocene, coincident with the emergence of Homo can be read to reflect low-yield scavenging, not hunting. Our review of the archaeology yields results consistent with these critiques: (1) early humans acquired large-bodied ungulates primarily by aggressive scavenging, not hunting; (2) meat was consumed at or near the point of acquisition, not at home bases, as the hunting hypothesis requires; (3) carcasses were taken at highly variable rates and in varying degrees of completeness, making meat from big game an even less reliable food source than it is among modern foragers. Collectively, Plio-Pleistocene site location and assemblage composition are consistent with the hypothesis that large carcasses were taken not for purposes of provisioning, but in the context of competitive male displays. Even if meat were acquired more reliably than the archaeology indicates, its consumption cannot account for the significant changes in life history now seen to distinguish early humans from ancestral australopiths. The coincidence between the earliest dates for Homo ergaster and an increase in the archaeological visibility of meat eating that many find so provocative instead reflects: (1) changes in the structure of the environment that concentrated scavenging opportunities in space, making evidence of their pursuit more obvious to archaeologists; (2) H. ergaster's larger body size (itself a consequence of other factors), which improved its ability at interference competition.},

abstract = {A common idiom in biology education states, "Eyes in the front, the animal hunts. Eyes on the side, the animal hides." In this paper, we explore one possible explanation for why predators tend to have forward-facing, high-acuity visual systems. We do so using an agent-based computational model of evolution, where predators and prey interact and adapt their behavior and morphology to one another over successive generations of evolution. In this model, we observe a coevolutionary cycle between prey swarming behavior and the predator's visual system, where the predator and prey continually adapt their visual system and behavior, respectively, over evolutionary time in reaction to one another due to the well-known "predator confusion effect." Furthermore, we provide evidence that the predator visual system is what drives this coevolutionary cycle, and suggest that the cycle could be closed if the predator evolves a hybrid visual system capable of narrow, high-acuity vision for tracking prey as well as broad, coarse vision for prey discovery. Thus, the conflicting demands imposed on a predator's visual system by the predator confusion effect could have led to the evolution of complex eyes in many predators.},

abstract = {In the animal world, collective action to shelter, protect and nourish requires the cooperation of group members. Among humans, many situations require the cooperation of more than two individuals simultaneously. Most of the relevant literature has focused on an extreme case, the N-person Prisoner's Dilemma. Here we introduce a model in which a threshold less than the total group is required to produce benefits, with increasing participation leading to increasing productivity. This model constitutes a generalization of the two-person stag hunt game to an N-person game. Both finite and infinite population models are studied. In infinite populations this leads to a rich dynamics that admits multiple equilibria. Scenarios of defector dominance, pure coordination or coexistence may arise simultaneously. On the other hand, whenever one takes into account that populations are finite and when their size is of the same order of magnitude as the group size, the evolutionary dynamics is profoundly affected: it may ultimately invert the direction of natural selection, compared with the infinite population limit.},

Female African lions demonstrate a unique form of plural breeding in which companions consistently produce similar numbers of surviving offspring. Consistent with theoretical predictions from models of reproductive skew, female lions are unable to control each other's reproduction because of high costs of fighting and low access to each other's newborn cubs. A female also lacks incentives to reduce her companions' reproduction, because her own survival and reproduction depend on group territoriality and synchronous breeding. Consequently, female relationships are highly symmetrical, and female lions are "free agents" who only contribute to communal care when they have cubs of their own.},

abstract = {Within the context of multiple mobile robot sys- tems, this chapter explores the current state of the art. After a brief introduction, we first ex- amine architectures for multirobot cooperation, exploring the alternative approaches that have been developed. Next, we explore communi- cations issues and their impact on multirobot teams in Sect. 40.3, followed by a discussion of swarm robot systems in Sect. 40.4. While swarm systems typically assume large numbers of homogeneous robots, other types of mul- tirobot systems include heterogeneous robots. We therefore next discuss heterogeneity in co- operative robot teams in Sect. 40.5. Once robot teams allow for individual heterogeneity, issues of task allocation become important; Sect. 40.6 therefore discusses common approaches to task allocation. Section 40.7 discusses the challenges of multirobot learning, and some representa- tive approaches. We outline some of the typical application domains which serve as test beds for multirobot systems research in Sect. 40.8. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 40.9 with some summary remarks and suggestions for further reading.},

@book{Pfeifer2007,
abstract = {How could the body influence our thinking when it seems obvious that the brain controls the body? In How the Body Shapes the Way We Think, Rolf Pfeifer and Josh Bongard demonstrate that thought is not independent of the body but is tightly constrained, and at the same time enabled, by it. They argue that the kinds of thoughts we are capable of have their foundation in our embodimentin our morphology and the material properties of our bodies. This crucial notion of embodiment underlies fundamental changes in the field of artificial intelligence over the past two decades, and Pfeifer and Bongard use the basic methodology of artificial intelligence"understanding by building"to describe their insights. If we understand how to design and build intelligent systems, they reason, we will better understand intelligence in general. In accessible, nontechnical language, and using many examples, they introduce the basic concepts by building on recent developments in robotics, biology, neuroscience, and psychology to outline a possible theory of intelligence. They illustrate applications of such a theory in ubiquitous computing, business and management, and the psychology of human memory. Embodied intelligence, as described by Pfeifer and Bongard, has important implications for our understanding of both natural and artificial intelligence.},

@article{Pontzer2012,
abstract = {Models for the origin of the genus Homo propose that increased quality of diet led to changes in ranging ecology and selection for greater locomotor economy, speed, and endurance. Here, I examine the fossil evidence for postcranial change in early Homo and draw on comparative data from living mammals to assess whether increased diet quality has led to selection for improved locomotor performance in other lineages. Body mass estimates indicate early Homo, both males and females, were approximately 33{\%} larger than australopiths, consistent with archeological evidence indicating an ecological change with the origins of our genus. However, many of the postcranial features thought to be derived in Homo, including longer hind limbs, are present in Australopithecus, challenging the hypothesis that early Homo is marked by significant change in walking and running performance. Analysis of energy budgets across mammals suggests that the larger body mass and increased diet quality in early Homo may reflect an increase in the hominin energy budget. Expanding the energy budget would enable greater investment in reproduction without decreasing energy available for larger brains or increased activity. Food sharing and increased adiposity, which decrease variance in food energy availability, may have been integral to this metabolic strategy.},

@article{Popat2012,
abstract = {The idea from human societies that self-interest can lead to a breakdown of cooperation at the group level is sometimes termed the public goods dilemma. We tested this idea in the opportunistic bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, by examining the influence of putative cheats that do not cooperate via cell-to-cell signalling (quorum-sensing, QS). We found that: (i) QS cheating occurs in biofilm populations owing to exploitation of QS-regulated public goods; (ii) the thickness and density of biofilms was reduced by the presence of non-cooperative cheats; (iii) population growth was reduced by the presence of cheats, and this reduction was greater in biofilms than in planktonic populations; (iv) the susceptibility of biofilms to antibiotics was increased by the presence of cheats; and (v) coercing cooperator cells to increase their level of cooperation decreases the extent to which the presence of cheats reduces population productivity. Our results provide clear support that conflict over public goods reduces population fitness in bacterial biofilms, and that this effect is greater than in planktonic populations. Finally, we discuss the clinical implications that arise from altering the susceptibility to antibiotics.},

The alternative “greenbeard” mechanism, in which an allele directly recognizes and aids copies of itself in others, is generally thought to be too complex for a single gene to carry out. The csA gene inDictyostelium discoideum acts as a single-gene greenbeard. When wild-type cells are mixed with csA-knockout cells, the wild type is more altruistic, but is also able preferentially to direct the benefits to other wild-type cells. Both properties derive directly from homophilic cell adhesion of the protein encoded by csA.},

We describe the behaviour of a successful system in which robots adopt and maintain functionally distinct roles in order to achieve the task.

abstract = {The aggregate motion of a flock of birds, a herd of land animals, or a school of fish is a beautiful and familiar part of the natural world. But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle system, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

abstract = {Coordinated motion in a group of simulated critters can evolve under selection pressure from an appropriate fitness criteria. Evolution is modeled with the Genetic Programming paradigm. The simulated environment consists of a group of critters, some static obstacles, and a predator. In order to survive, the critters must avoid collisions (with obstacles as well as with each other) and must avoid predation. They must steer a safe path through the dynamic environment using only information received through their visual sensors. The arrangement of visual sensors, as well as the mapping from sensor data to motor action is determined by the evolved controller program. The motor model assumes an innate constant forward velocity and limited steering. The predator preferentially targets isolated "stragglers" and so encourages aggregation. Fitness is based on the sum of all critter lifetimes.},

Creating this ability in engineered systems poses challenges in the design of both algorithms and physical systems that can operate at such scales. We report a system that demonstrates programmable self-assembly of complex two-dimensional shapes with a thousand-robot swarm. This was enabled by creating autonomous robots designed to operate in large groups and to cooperate through local interactions and by developing a collective algorithm for shape formation that is highly robust to the variability and error characteristic of large-scale decentralized systems.

@article{Russell2001,
abstract = {The widespread belief that kin selection is necessary for the evolution of cooperative breeding in vertebrates has recently been questioned. These doubts have primarily arisen because of the paucity of unequivocal evidence for kin preferences in cooperative behaviour. Using the cooperative breeding system of long-tailed tits (Aegithalos caudatus) in which kin and non-kin breed within each social unit and helpers are failed breeders, we investigated whether helpers preferentially direct their care towards kin following breeding failure. First, using observational data, we show that not all failed breeders actually become helpers, but that those that do help usually do so at the nest of a close relative. Second, we confirm the importance of kinship for helping in this species by conducting a choice experiment. We show that potential helpers do not become helpers in the absence of close kin and, when given a choice between helping equidistant broods belonging to kin and non-kin within the same social unit, virtually all helped at the nest of kin. This study provides strong evidence that kinship plays an essential role in the maintenance of cooperative breeding in this species.},

Early experiments which she fundamental problem in this important dispute has been that dancing bees advertise a food location with site-specific odoer information as well as symbolic distance and direction coordinates. A new technique has overcome this problem and demonstrated that von Frisch's dance language theory is, on the whole, correct. The apparently contradictory results of Wenner and his colleagues are shown to be due to their techniques for training bees. The dance-language controversy raises issues beyond how bees communicate. These include whether and when "evolutionary" arguments are useful, and to what extent Kuhn's scientific revolution paradign fits the dispute.},

This fact contrasts with the traditional homogeneous setting used in studies of evolutionary game dynamics. We incorporate heterogeneity in the population by studying games on graphs, in which the variability in connectivity ranges from single-scale graphs, for which heterogeneity is small and associated degree distributions exhibit a Gaussian tale, to scale-free graphs, for which heterogeneity is large with degree distributions exhibiting a power-law behavior. We study the evolution of cooperation, modeled in terms of the most popular dilemmas of cooperation. We show that, for all dilemmas, increasing heterogeneity favors the emergence of cooperation, such that long-term cooperative behavior easily resists short-term noncooperative behavior. Moreover, we show how cooperation depends on the intricate ties between individuals in scale-free populations.},

But since social systems are strongly influenced by ecological conditions, it seemed that it might be more productive to compare hominids with animals which are ecologically but not necessarily phylogenetically similar, such as the social carnivores. The group dynamics, dominance hierarchies, land tenure systems, co-operative hunting techniques, and the like of the wolf, wild dog, hyena, and lion were compared with those of contemporary hunter-gatherers and, by inference, those of early hominids. It was concluded that the selective forces shaping human society were in many respects different from those that influenced non-human primates, especially with respect to co-operative hunting, food-sharing, and the division of labor. Field experiments were made in Tanzania to ascertain the relative importance of scavenging and hunting in the subsistence of hominids.},

abstract = {To properly understand behavior, we must obtain both ultimate and proximate explanations. Put briefly, ultimate explanations are concerned with why a behavior exists, and proximate explanations are concerned with how it works. These two types of explanation are complementary and the distinction is critical to evolutionary explanation. We are concerned that they have become conflated in some areas of the evolutionary literature on human behavior. This article brings attention to these issues. We focus on three specific areas: the evolution of cooperation, transmitted culture, and epigenetics. We do this to avoid confusion and wasted effort--dangers that are particularly acute in interdisciplinary research. Throughout this article, we suggest ways in which misunderstanding may be avoided in the future.},

abstract = {In many cooperatively breeding birds, kin selection has an important role in the evolution and maintenance of social behaviour, and ‘helpers' can maximize indirect fitness gains by preferentially allocating care to close relatives. Although there is evidence for kin-biased helping behaviour in several species, the mechanism of kin recognition underlying this behaviour is poorly understood. Vocalizations are the most commonly used cues in avian recognition systems, but the effectiveness of vocal signals as reliable recognition cues must depend on how they are acquired. However, there have been no experimental studies of the development of vocal recognition cues in cooperative birds; indeed, the ontogeny of all bird vocalizations other than song is poorly known in any species. Here, we show that cooperatively breeding long-tailed tits (Aegithalos caudatus) can discriminate between kin and non-kin according to the individual-specific characteristics of contact calls, and show experimentally that individuals learn these calls from provisioning adults during the nestling period. Finally, we show that the pattern of cooperative behaviour in this species is consistent with the use of recognition cues learned through association.},

@article{Smith2010,
abstract = {Coalitionary support in agonistic interactions represents cooperation because intervening in a fight is potentially costly to the donor of support but benefits the recipient. Here, we first review the characteristics of, and evolutionary forces favoring, intragroup coalitions in 49 species and find that patterns of intragroup coalition formation are remarkably similar between primates and nonprimates. We then test hypotheses suggesting kin selection, reciprocal altruism, and direct benefits as adaptive explanations for coalitionary interventions among adult female spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) belonging to a large social group in Kenya. As predicted by kin selection theory, females supported close kin most often, and the density (connectedness) of cooperation networks increased with genetic relatedness. Nevertheless, kinship failed to protect females from coalitionary attacks. We found no evidence of enduring alliances based on reciprocal support among unrelated adult females. Instead, donors generally minimized costs to themselves, intervening most often during low-intensity fights and when feeding opportunities were unavailable. Females also gained direct benefits from directing coalitionary attacks toward subordinates. Finally, females monitored the number of dominant bystanders in the "audience" at fights and modified their level of cooperation based on this knowledge. Overall, hyenas made flexible decisions regarding whether or not to intervene in fights, modifying their tendency to cooperate based on multiple types of information about their immediate social and ecological environments. Taken together, these findings indicate that the combined evolutionary forces of kin selection and direct benefits derived from reinforcing the status quo drive coalitionary interventions among adult female spotted hyenas.},

abstract = {Individually identified lions (Panthera leo) were observed on the open, semi-arid plains in Namibia. Data from 486 coordinated group hunts were analysed to assess cooperation and individual variation in hunting tactics. Group hunts generally involved a formation whereby some lionesses ("wings") circled prey while others (" centres ") waited for prey to move towards them. Those lionesses that occupied "wing" stalking roles frequently initiated an attack on the prey, while lionesses in "centre" roles moved relatively small dis- tances and most often captured prey in flight from other lionesses. Each lioness in a given pride repeatedly occu- pied the same position in a hunting formation. Hunts where most lionesses present occupied their preferred positions had a high probability of success. Individual hunting behaviour was not inflexible, however, but var- ied according to different group compositions and to variations in the behaviour of other individuals present. The role of cooperative hunting and its apparent advan- tages within the semi-arid environment of Etosha Na- tional Park, Namibia, are discussed},

abstract = {Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) has existed as a subfield of AI for less than two decades. DAI is concerned with systems that consist of multiple independent entities that interact in a domain. Traditionally, DAI has been divided into two sub-disciplines: Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) focuses on the information management aspects of systems with several branches working together towards a common goal; Multiagent Systems (MAS) deals with behavior management in collections of several independent entities, or agents. This survey of MAS is intended to serve as an introduction to the field and as an organizational framework. A series of general multiagent scenarios are presented. For each scenario, the issues that arise are described along with a sampling of the techniques that exist to deal with them. The presented techniques are not exhaustive, but they highlight how multiagent systems can be and have been used to build complex systems. When options exist, the techniques presented are biased towards machine learning approaches. Additional opportunities for applying machine learning to MAS are highlighted and robotic soccer is presented as an appropriate test-bed for MAS. This survey does not focus exclusively on robotic systems since much of the prior research in non-robotic MAS applies to robotic systems as well. However, several robotic MAS, including all of those presented in this issue, are discussed.},

Most of the time, D. discoideum lives as haploid, free-living, amoeboid cells that divide asexually. When starved, 10(4)-10(5) of these cells aggregate into a slug. The anterior 20{\%} of the slug altruistically differentiates into a non-viable stalk, supporting the remaining cells, most of which become viable spores. If aggregating cells come from multiple clones, there should be selection for clones to exploit other clones by contributing less than their proportional share to the sterile stalk. Here we use microsatellite markers to show that different clones collected from a field population readily mix to form chimaeras. Half of the chimaeric mixtures show a clear cheater and victim. Thus, unlike the clonal and highly cooperative development of most multicellular organisms, the development of D. discoideum is partly competitive, with conflicts of interests among cells. These conflicts complicate the use of D. discoideum as a model for some aspects of development, but they make it highly attractive as a model system for social evolution.},

In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning. Their discussion ranges from the history of the field's intellectual foundations to the most recent developments and applications. The only necessary mathematical background is familiarity with elementary concepts of probability.The book is divided into three parts. Part I defines the reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. Part II provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal-difference learning. Part III presents a unified view of the solution methods and incorporates artificial neural networks, eligibility traces, and planning; the two final chapters present case studies and consider the future of reinforcement learning.},

In this paper we explore an alternative approach in which the policy is explicitly represented by its own function approximator, independent of the value function, and is updated according to the gradient of expected reward with respect to the policy parameters. Williams's REINFORCE method and actor-critic methods are examples of this approach. Our main new result is to show that the gradient can be written in a form suitable for estimation from experience aided by an approximate action-value or advantage function. Using this result, we prove for the ¯rst time that a version of policy iteration with arbitrary di{\textregistered}erentiable function approximation is convergent to a locally optimal policy.},

abstract = {Abstract Soft robots offer many advantages over traditional rigid robots. However, soft robots can be difficult to control with standard control methods. Fortunately, evolutionary algorithms can offer an elegant solution to this problem. Instead of creating controls to handle the intricate dynamics of these robots, we can simply evolve the controls using a simulation to provide an evaluation function. In this article, we show how such a control paradigm can be applied to an emerging field within soft robotics: robots based on tensegrity structures. We take the model of the Spherical Underactuated Planetary Exploration Robot ball (SUPERball), an icosahedron tensegrity robot under production at NASA Ames Research Center, develop a rolling locomotion algorithm, and study the learned behavior using an accurate model of the SUPERball simulated in the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit. We first present the historical- average fitness-shaping algorithm for coevolutionary algorithms to speed up learning while favoring robustness over optimality. Second, we use a distributed control approach by coevolving open-loop control signals for each controller. Being simple and distributed, open-loop controllers can be readily implemented on SUPERball hardware without the need for sensor information or precise coordination. We analyze signals of different complexities and frequencies. Among the learned policies, we take one of the best and use it to analyze different aspects of the rolling gait, such as lengths, tensions, and energy consumption. We also discuss the correlation between the signals controlling different parts of the tensegrity robot. A},

abstract = {Ich habe in diesem Aufsatz kurz anzudeuten versucht, was meiner Ansicht nach das Wesentliche in Fragestellung und Methode der Ethologie ist und weshalb wir in Konrad Lorenz den Begr{\"{u}}nder moderner Ethologie erblicken. Hierbei habe ich vielleicht das Arbeitsgebiet der Ethologie weiter gefa{\ss}t, als unter Ethologen gebr{\"{a}}uchlich ist. Wenn man aber die vielartige Arbeit jener Forscher {\"{u}}bersieht, die sich Ethologen nennen, ist man zu dieser weiten Fassung geradezu gezwungen. Ich habe in meiner Darstellung weder Vollst{\"{a}}ndigkeit noch Gleichgewicht angestrebt und, um zur Fortf{\"{u}}hrung des Gespr{\"{a}}chs anzuregen, ruhig meine Steckenpferde geritten, vor allem das Verh{\"{a}}ltnis zwischen Ethologie und Physiologie, die Gefahr der Vernachl{\"{a}}ssigung der Frage der Arterhaltung, Fragen der Methodik der ontogenetischen Forschung, und Aufgaben und Methoden der Evolutionsforschung. Bei der Einsch{\"{a}}tzung des Anteils, den Lorenz an der Entwicklung der Ethologie genommen hat und noch nimmt, habe ich als seinen Hauptbeitrag den bezeichnet, da{\ss} er uns gezeigt hat, wie man bew{\"{a}}hrtes biologisches Denken folgerichtig auf Verhalten anwenden kann. Da{\ss} er dabei an die Arbeit seiner Vorg{\"{a}}nger angekn{\"{u}}pft hat, ist nicht mehr verwunderlich, als da{\ss} jeder Vater selbst einen Vater hat. Insbesondere scheint mir das Wesentliche an Lorenz Arbeit zu sein, da{\ss} er klar gesehen hat, da{\ss} Verhaltensweisen Teile von Organen, von Systemen der Arterhaltung sind; da{\ss} ihre Verursachung genau so exakt untersucht werden kann wie die gleich welcher anderer Lebensvorg{\"{a}}nge, da{\ss} ihr arterhaltender Wert ebenso systematisch und exakt aufweisbar ist wie ihre Verursachung, da{\ss} Verhaltensontogenie in grunds{\"{a}}tzlich gleicher Weise erforscht werden kann wie die Ontogenie der Form und da{\ss} die Erforschung der Verhaltensevolution der Untersuchung der Strukturevolution parallel geht. Und obwohl Lorenz ein riesiges Tatsachenmaterial gesammelt hat, ist die Ethologie doch noch mehr durch seine Fragestellung und durch k{\"{u}}hne Hypothesen gef{\"{o}}rdert als durch eigene Nachpr{\"{u}}fung dieser Hypothesen. Ohne den Wert solcher Nachpr{\"{u}}fung zu untersch{\"{a}}tzen ohne die es nat{\"{u}}rlich keine Weiterentwicklung g{\"{a}}be m{\"{o}}chte ich doch behaupten, da{\ss} die durch Nachpr{\"{u}}fung notwendig gewordenen Modifikationen neben der Leistung des urspr{\"{u}}nglichen Ansatzes vergleichsweise unbedeutend sind. Nebenbei sei auch daran erinnert, da{\ss} eine der vielen heilsamen Nachwirkungen der Lorenzschen Arbeit das wachsende Interesse ist, das die Humanpsychologie der Ethologie entgegenbringt - ein erster Ansatz einer Entwicklung, deren Tragweite wir noch kaum {\"{u}}bersehen k{\"{o}}nnen. Am Schlu{\ss} noch eine Bemerkung zur Terminologie. Ich habe hier das Wort Ethologie auf einen Riesenkomplex von Wissenschaften angewandt, von denen manche, wie Psychologie und Physiologie, schon l{\"{a}}ngst anerkannte Namen tragen. Das hei{\ss}t nat{\"{u}}rlich nicht, da{\ss} ich den Namen Ethologie f{\"{u}}r dieses ganze Gebiet vorschlagen will; das w{\"{a}}re geschichtlich einfach falsch, weil das Wort historisch nur die Arbeit einer kleinen Gruppe von Zoologen kennzeichnet. Der Name ist nat{\"{u}}rlich gleichg{\"{u}}ltig; worauf es mir vor allem ankommt, ist darzutun, da{\ss} wir das Zusammenwachsen vieler Einzeldisziplinen zu einer vielumfassenden Wissenschaft erleben, f{\"{u}}r die es nur einen richtigen Namen gibt: Verhaltensbiologie. Selbstverst{\"{a}}ndlich ist diese synthetische Entwicklung nicht die Arbeit eines Mannes oder gar die der Ethologen. Sie ist die Folge einer allgemeinen Neigung, Br{\"{u}}cken zwischen verwandten Wissenschaften zu schlagen, einer Neigung, die sich in vielen Disziplinen entwickelt hat. Unter den Zoologen ist es Lorenz, der hierzu am meisten beigetragen und zudem manche Nachbardisziplinen st{\"{a}}rker beeinflu{\ss}t hat als irgendein anderer. Ich bin sogar davon {\"{u}}berzeugt, da{\ss} diese Einwirkungen auf Nachbarwissenschaften noch lange anhalten werden und da{\ss} die Verhaltensbiologie erst am Anfang ihrer Ontogenie steht.},

abstract = {Modern theories of the evolution of human cooperation focus mainly on altruism. In contrast, we propose that humans' species-unique forms of cooperation—as well as their species-unique forms of cognition, communication, and social life—all derive from mutualistic collaboration (with social selection against cheaters). In a first step, humans became obligate collaborative foragers such that individuals were interdependent with one another and so had a direct interest in the well-being of their partners. In this context, they evolved new skills and motivations for collaboration not possessed by other great apes (joint intentionality), and they helped their potential partners (and avoided cheaters). In a second step, these new collaborative skills and motivations were scaled up to group life in general, as modern humans faced competition from other groups. As part of this new group-mindedness, they created cultural conventions, norms, and institutions (all characterized by collective intentionality), with knowledge of a specific set of these marking individuals as members of a particular cultural group. Human cognition and sociality thus became ever more collaborative and altruistic as human individuals became ever more interdependent.},

abstract = {A model is presented to account for the natural selection of what is termed recipro- cally altruistic behavior. The model shows how selection can operate -against the cheater (non-reciprocator) in the system. Three instances of altruistic behavior are discussed, the evolution of which the model can explain: (1) behavior involved in cleaning symbioses; (2) warning cries in birds: and (3) human reciprocal altruism. Regarding human reciprocal altruism, it is shown that the details of the psycho- logical system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the model. Spe- cifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression, gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic system. Each individual human is seen as possessing altruistic and cheating tendencies, the expression of which is sensitive to developmental variables that were selected to set the tendencies at a balance appropriate to the local social and ecological environment.},

We propose to evolve mechanisms for parameter self-organization instead of evolving the parameters themselves. The method consists of encoding a set of local adaptation rules that synapses follow while the robot freely moves in the environment. In the experiments presented here, the performance of the robot is measured in environments that are different in significant ways from those used during evolution. The results show that evolutionary adaptive controllers solve the task much faster and better than evolutionary standard fixed-weight controllers, that the method scales up well to large architectures, and that evolutionary adaptive controllers can adapt to environmental changes that involve new sensory characteristics (including transfer from simulation to reality and across different robotic platforms) and new spatial relationships.},

@article{VanBaalen1998,
abstract = {Group selection can overcome individual selection for selfishness and favour altruism if there is variation among the founders of spatially distinct groups, and groups with many altruists become substantially larger (or exist longer) than groups with few. Whether altruism can evolve in populations that do not have an alternation of local population growth and global dispersal ("viscous populations") has been disputed for some time. Limited dispersal protects the altruists from the non-altruists, but also hinders the export of altruism. In this article, we use the Pair Approximation technique (tracking the dynamics of pairs of neighbours instead of single individuals) to derive explicit invasion conditions for rare mutants in populations with limited dispersal. In such viscous populations, invading mutants form clusters, and ultimately, invasion conditions depend on the properties of such clusters. Thus there is selection on a higher level than that of the individual; in fact, invasion conditions define the unit of selection in viscous populations. We treat the evolution of altruism as a specific example, but the method is of more general interest. In particular, an important advantage is that spatial aspects can be incorporated into game theory in a straightforward fashion; we will specify the ESS for a more general model. The invasion conditions can be interpreted in terms of inclusive fitness. In contrast with Hamilton's model, the coefficient of relatedness is not merely a given genetical constant but depends on local population dynamical processes (birth, dispersal and death of individuals). With a simple birth rate function, Hamilton's rule is recovered: the cost to the donor should be less than the benefit to the recipient weighted with the coefficient of relatedness. As the coefficient of relatedness is roughly inversely proportional to an individual's number of neighbours, benefits to the recipient must be substantial to outweight the costs, confirming earlier studies. We discuss the consequences for the evolution of dispersal and outline how the method may be extended to study evolution in interacting populations. (C) 1998 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The efficiency of social insect colonies critically depends on their ability to efficiently allocate workers to the various tasks which need to be performed. While numerous models have investigated the mechanisms allowing an efficient colony response to external changes in the environment and internal perturbations, little attention has been devoted to the genetic architecture underlying task specialization. We used artificial evolution to compare the performances of three simple genetic architectures underlying within-colony variation in response thresholds of workers to five tasks. In the 'deterministic mapping' system, the thresholds of individuals for each of the five tasks is strictly genetically determined. In the second genetic architecture ('probabilistic mapping'), the genes only influence the probability of engaging in one of the tasks. Finally, in the 'dynamic mapping' system, the propensity of workers to engage in one of the five tasks depends not only on their own genotype, but also on the behavioural phenotypes of other colony members. We found that the deterministic mapping system performed well only when colonies consisted of unrelated individuals and were not subjected to perturbations in task allocation. The probabilistic mapping system performed well for colonies of related and unrelated individuals when there were no perturbations. Finally, the dynamic mapping system performed well under all conditions and was much more efficient than the two other mapping systems when there were perturbations. Overall, our simulations reveal that the type of mapping between genotype and individual behaviour greatly influences the dynamics of task specialization and colony productivity. Our simulations also reveal complex interactions between the mode of mapping, level of within-colony relatedness and risk of colony perturbations.},

abstract = {The evolution of altruism is a fundamental and enduring puzzle in biology. In a seminal paper Hamilton showed that altruism can be selected for when rb - c > 0, where c is the fitness cost to the altruist, b is the fitness benefit to the beneficiary, and r is their genetic relatedness. While many studies have provided qualitative support for Hamilton's rule, quantitative tests have not yet been possible due to the difficulty of quantifying the costs and benefits of helping acts. Here we use a simulated system of foraging robots to experimentally manipulate the costs and benefits of helping and determine the conditions under which altruism evolves. By conducting experimental evolution over hundreds of generations of selection in populations with different c/b ratios, we show that Hamilton's rule always accurately predicts the minimum relatedness necessary for altruism to evolve. This high accuracy is remarkable given the presence of pleiotropic and epistatic effects as well as mutations with strong effects on behavior and fitness (effects not directly taken into account in Hamilton's original 1964 rule). In addition to providing the first quantitative test of Hamilton's rule in a system with a complex mapping between genotype and phenotype, these experiments demonstrate the wide applicability of kin selection theory.},

Predicting high-level results given low-level rules is a key open challenge; the inverse problem, finding low-level rules that give specific outcomes, is in general still less understood. We present a multi-agent construction system inspired by mound-building termites, solving such an inverse problem. A user specifies a desired structure, and the system automatically generates low-level rules for independent climbing robots that guarantee production of that structure. Robots use only local sensing and coordinate their activity via the shared environment. We demonstrate the approach via a physical realization with three autonomous climbing robots limited to onboard sensing.

abstract = {Microorganisms communicate and cooperate to perform a wide range of multicellular behaviours, such as dispersal, nutrient acquisition, biofilm formation and quorum sensing. Microbiologists are rapidly gaining a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in these behaviours, and the underlying genetic regulation. Such behaviours are also interesting from the perspective of social evolution - why do microorganisms engage in these behaviours given that cooperative individuals can be exploited by selfish cheaters, who gain the benefit of cooperation without paying their share of the cost? There is great potential for interdisciplinary research in this fledgling field of sociomicrobiology, but a limiting factor is the lack of effective communication of social evolution theory to microbiologists. Here, we provide a conceptual overview of the different mechanisms through which cooperative behaviours can be stabilized, emphasizing the aspects most relevant to microorganisms, the novel problems that microorganisms pose and the new insights that can be gained from applying evolutionary theory to microorganisms},

abstract = {Natural selection favours genes that increase an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. This would appear to lead to a world dominated by selfish behaviour. However, cooperation can be found at all levels of biological organisation: genes cooperate in genomes, organelles cooperate to form eukaryotic cells, cells cooperate to make multicellular organisms, bacterial parasites cooperate to overcome host defences, animals breed cooperatively, and humans and insects cooperate to build societies. Over the last 40 years, biologists have developed a theoretical framework that can explain cooperation at all these levels. Here, we summarise this theory, illustrate how it may be applied to real organisms and discuss future directions.},

abstract = {From an evolutionary perspective, social behaviours are those which have fitness consequences for both the individual that performs the behaviour, and another individual. Over the last 43 years, a huge theoretical and empirical literature has developed on this topic. However, progress is often hindered by poor communication between scientists, with different people using the same term to mean different things, or different terms to mean the same thing. This can obscure what is biologically important, and what is not. The potential for such semantic confusion is greatest with interdisciplinary research. Our aim here is to address issues of semantic confusion that have arisen with research on the problem of cooperation. In particular, we: (i) discuss confusion over the terms kin selection, mutualism, mutual benefit, cooperation, altruism, reciprocal altruism, weak altruism, altruistic punishment, strong reciprocity, group selection and direct fitness; (ii) emphasize the need to distinguish between proximate (mechanism) and ultimate (survival value) explanations of behaviours. We draw examples from all areas, but especially recent work on humans and microbes.},

@article{Wilder2015,
abstract = {The evolutionary origin of altruism is a long-standing puzzle. Numerous explanations have been proposed, most prominently based on inclusive fitness or group selection. One possi-bility that has not yet been considered is that new niches will be created disproportionately often when altruism appears, perhaps by chance, causing altruists to be over-represented in such new niches. This effect is a novel variant of group selection in which altruistic groups benefit by discovering unoccupied niches instead of by competing for the limited resources within a single niche. Both an analytical population genetics model and computational simu-lations support that altruism systematically arises due to this side effect of increased carry-ing capacity even when it is strongly selected against within any given niche. In fact, even when selection is very strongly negative and altruism does not develop in most populations, it can still be expected to be observed in a consistent fraction of species. The ecological structure provided by niches thereby may be sufficient for altruists to proliferate even if they are always at a disadvantage within each niche considered individually.},

@article{Wilson1998,
abstract = {This work ties together two distinct modeling frameworks for population dynamics: an individual-based simulation and a set of coupled integrodifferential equations involving population densities. The simulation model represents an idealized predator-prey system formulated at the scale of discrete individuals, explicitly incorporating their mutual interactions, whereas the population-level framework is a generalized version of reaction-diffusion models that incorporate population densities coupled to one another by interaction rates. Here I use various combinations of long-range dispersal for both the offspring and adult stages of both prey and predator species, providing a broad range of spatial and temporal dynamics, to compare and contrast the two model frameworks. Taking the individual-based modeling results as given, two examinations of the reaction-dispersal model are made: linear stability analysis of the deterministic equations and direct numerical solution of the model equations. I also modify the numerical solution in two ways to account for the stochastic nature of individual-based processes, which include independent, local perturbations in population density and a minimum population density within integration cells, below which the population is set to zero. These modifications introduce new parameters into the population-level model, which I adjust to reproduce the individual-based model results. The individual-based model is then modified to minimize the effects of stochasticity, producing a match of the predictions from the numerical integration of the population-level model without stochasticity.},

@article{Wilson2008,
abstract = {The advanced colonial state of eusociality has evolved in insects as a defense of nest sites within foraging distance of persistent food sources. In the Hymenoptera, the final step in the approach to eusociality is through a suite of preadaptations comprising simultaneous provisioning, fidelity to the nest, and a preexisting propensity toward dominance behavior and the selection of tasks according to opportunity. The only genetic change needed to cross the threshold to the eusocial grade is the foundress's possession of an allele that holds the foundress and her offspring to the nest. The preadaptations provide the phenotypic flexibility required for eusociality, as well as the key emergent traits arising from interactions of the group members. Group (colony-level) selection then immediately acts on both of these traits. The rarity of the origin of eusociality is evidently due to the rarity of the combination of progressive provisioning with environments of the kind that give an edge to group selection over individual direct selection, causing offspring to stay at the natal nest rather than disperse. Several lines of evidence, examined here, suggest that collateral kin selection does not play a significant role.},

@article{Wrangham1999,
abstract = {Cooking is a human universal that must have had widespread effects on the nutrition, ecology, and social relationships of the species that invented it. The location and timing of its origins are unknown, but it should have left strong signals in the fossil record. We suggest that such signals are detectable at ca. 1.9 million years ago in the reduced digestive effort (e.g., smaller teeth) and increased supply of food energy (e.g., larger female body mass) of early Homo erectus. The adoption of cooking required delay of the consumption of food while it was accumulated and/or brought to a processing area, and accumulations of food were valuable and stealable. Dominant (e.g., larger) individuals (typically male) were therefore able to scrounge from subordinate (e.g., smaller) individuals (typically female) instead of relying on their own foraging efforts. Because female fitness is limited by access to resources (particularly energetic resources), this dynamic would have favored females able to minimize losses to theft. To do so, we suggest, females formed protective relationships with male co-defenders. Males would have varied in their ability or willingness to engage effectively in this relationship, so females would have competed for the best food guards, partly by extending their period of sexual attractiveness. This would have increased the numbers of matings per pregnancy, reducing the intensity of male intrasexual competition. Consequently, there was reduced selection for males to be relatively large. This scenario is supported by the fossil record, which indicates that the relative body size of males fell only once in hominid evolution, around the time when H. erectus evolved. Therefore we suggest that cooking was responsible for the evolution of the unusual human social system in which pair bonds are embedded within multifemale, multimale communities and supported by strong mutual and frequently conflicting sexual interest.},

@article{Wright2001,
abstract = {Cooperative sentinel behaviour in Arabian babblers, Turdoides squamiceps, appears generally consistent with state-dependent models of individually selfish antipredator behaviour. We examined further detailed aspects of this cooperative behaviour, including the suggestion that by engaging in this behaviour sentinels advertise their status and gain social prestige. Chosen sentinel locations were higher, but no more exposed, than the best alternative locations within 25 m. Sentinels started off closer to the centre of the foraging group than when sentinel bouts were terminated. Change-overs between sentinels were nearly always due to previous sentinels terminating their own bout. On the rare occasions when bouts were interrupted by upcoming sentinels, physical contact or aggression was extremely rare. Dominant males tended to terminate sentinel bouts of other birds, interrupting especially the dominant females. Other than this, there was no effect of an individual's sex or dominance rank on any aspect of sentinel change-overs or location choice when acting as a sentinel. There were also no differences in any sentinel activity between simple family groups, and those more complex nonfamily groups within which indviduals compete for reproduction. Rates of alarm calling did not differ between group members, although dominant males did make more territorial calls to neighbouring groups while acting as a sentinel. Therefore, we found relatively little evidence that individuals compete for the chance to act as a sentinel as a means of showing off within groups of Arabian babblers. Instead, our study confirms the primary function of sentinels as a system of cooperative vigilance.},

@article{Yong2009,
abstract = {In certain tasks such as pursuit and evasion, multiple agents need to coordinate their behavior to achieve a common goal. An interesting question is, how can such behavior be best evolved? A powerful approach is to control the agents with neural networks, coevolve themin separate subpopulations, and test them together in the common task. In this paper, such a method, called Multi-Agent ESP (Enforced SubPopulations), is proposed and demonstrated in a prey-capture task. First, the approach is shown more efficient than evolving a single central controller for all agents. Second, cooperation is found to bemost efficient through stigmergy, i.e. through role-based responses to the environment, rather than direct communication between the agents. Together these results suggest that role-based cooperation is an effective strategy in certain multi-agent domains. [},
