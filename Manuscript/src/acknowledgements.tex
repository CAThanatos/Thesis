A thesis can hardly be considered as the work of a single individual. It is dependent on collaborations, discussions and encouragements from many different people. As such I would like to express them my deepest gratitude.

First, I would like to thank Guillaume Beslon, Aurélie Beynier, Pierre-Henri Gouyon, Nicolas Maudet and Richard Watson for having accepter to be part of my thesis committee. This represents a substantial amount of work and I am very grateful that they could take some time to read my manuscript and attend my defense. Additionally I want to thank Guillaume and Richard for reviewing the manuscript and providing very helpful comments and corrections.

I want to thank in particular my two supervisors Jean-Baptiste Andre and Nicolas Bredeche without whom I would not be writing this acknowledgements right now. It may appear cheesy but I could not have ask for better advisors. They knew exactly when to encourage or push me and really made sure that this thesis could go as smoothly as possible for this kind of work. This was a pleasure to discuss and work with them and I consider most of this work to be as much mine as it is theirs. I must especially thank Nicolas for his active presence, helpful supervision and frequent interactions. It was a pleasure to discuss science as much as video games and music. I have also Nicolas to thank for getting me into research and providing me helpful directions when I was looking to do a PhD. Thanks to him, I was able to leave my job for more stressful and less paying but much more rewarding experience. I am also grateful to Jean-Baptiste for teaching me most of what I now know about evolutionary biology. He was often enthusiastic and very optimistic about the results of this work which was helpful in the inevitable moments of doubts that happened during these 3 years.

I had the chance to work in an exceptional environment at ISIR (despite the summer temperatures). I want to thank all the wonderful people I met there and with which it was a pleasure to interact. I want to address special thanks to Benoît, Jean-Baptiste, Medhi and Stéphane for their general kindness and interesting discussions even beyond scientific matters. I am grateful to my colleagues with whom I shared the J01 and 310 offices. Those offices were messy, noisy and at times even dangerous because of our overall lack of skill at throwing darts. Thus a perfect environment. I want first to thank the Elders, the ones that were finishing their PhD as I was only starting mine: Charles, Charles (the other one), Florian and Jean. I would have loved spending more time with you all. Then I thank those with whom I spent most of my time here and made this experimence a lot more pleasant (most of the time). First many thanks to Alain, even if I'm not sure to which extent you were really good for the productivity of the office. Anyway your frequent (some would say constant) breaks in our office would always lighten the mood and give the opportunity to pull a prank on soemone. Thanks to Antoine for the pleasant discussions and choosing to take into your hand
